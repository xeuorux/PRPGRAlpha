即时新闻！
I'm live here at <imp>Tri Island</imp>, a mysterious island discovered recently off the coast of Makya.
最近在马凯亚附近的海域，\n发现了一座新的岛屿，\n我现在就在这座<imp>三相岛</imp>。
Trainers from all over the world are making their way over as there have been sightings of extremely rare Pokemon and resources.
因为这里发现了极其罕见的宝可梦，\n目前世界各地都有训练家向此地进发。
With no region claiming major jurisdiction over the island, there have been reports of multiple factions creating base camps in the area.
由于目前没有任何一个地区，\n对此岛屿宣称了主权，\n因此很多派别都于岛上建立了营地。
The only thing that's certain here is the battling as Trainers duke it out over territory and access to these new wild areas.
我们目前唯一可以确定的是，\n这里的训练家们会为了争夺领地，\n进入这片新世界而展开战斗。
But for now, we'll be providing live coverage of the event. Over and out.
这次的报道到此结束，\n谢谢大家的收看。
Uh -- yes? Did you want to ask me something?
啊...那个，你想问我什么吗？
Well then don't -- can you not -- I'm not a big fan of being stared at.
那你...能不能...不要这样...\n一直盯着我看？\n我...不喜欢这样。
I just like... I’m a wanderer. Or, rather, not a wanderer -- but I don't have a home -- or, well -- excuse me. I spend most of my time in caves.
我只是喜欢...我...是个流浪者。\n或者说...不是流浪...只是...\n我没有家...我...抱歉，大部分时间...\n我都待在山洞里。
I don't know? I mean -- no, I know, but rather I'm not sure why -- I mean, what kind of question is that? I'm a Pokémon trainer.
我不知道...不是，我是说...\n我知道...但是我不确定...\n不对，这是个什么问题？\n我是个宝可梦训练家。
Or I was. And I’m... rather good at it. And not much else.
或者说以前是...\n并且我...擅长这个。\n并且...其他方面不行。
A friend's. Just a friend's. I'm good at -- they entrust me with the training. I get results.
一个朋友的，只是朋友...\n我...擅长...所以他们...\n委托我帮忙训练...我...有成绩。
I mean, that sounds -- that's not what I really meant. I'm -- I'm -- I was -- let's move on.
我是说，这...不是我的想法...\n我...我...我...继续前进吧。
Heyo, \PN. Hear you’ve been busy.
喂，\PN，听说你很忙。
You’re just racking up badges like they’re nothing, huh? Mavis must be so proud.
你不会徽章都能堆成小山了吧？\n哈，梅维斯肯定会为你骄傲的。
It’s not a compliment. Just stating the facts.
这不是恭维，陈述事实而已。
And the fact is that you’re not getting anywhere now unless you come meet me, for reasons that make me too angry to explain.
但现在的情况是，你得来见我，\n不然你哪儿也去不了，\n至于原因，让我气得解释不了。
I’ve got a <imp>gift</imp> for you.
我会给你带一份<imp>礼物</imp>。
I’m literally friends with two - I mean ONE - of those gym leaders, and I was the commanding officer for half the people keeping track of Rafael.
我跟其中两个...或者说一个\n道馆馆主是朋友关系，\n刚想到的另一个朋友，\n是拉斐尔身边的义军队长。
Word gets around.
所以消息来得很快。
I also know that you’re gonna have some issues getting <imp>across that river</imp> without my help.
而且我清楚，\n如果没有我的帮助，\n你没有可以<imp>过河</imp>的方法。
Yikes.
啊。
Yeah, Mavis is… Mavis.
也对，梅维斯...是那个梅维斯。
You know, you… ah, nevermind. Eye on the prize and all that.
你知道你...啊，算了，\n总之你应该想要奖品吧。
Speaking of which, you need to get <imp>across the river</imp>, yeah?
你现在是不是\n在为<imp>过河</imp>的事发愁？
We might be able to reach an arrangement...
或许你可以试试完成我的安排...
But. But... you know how this works.
不过...我得先说清楚需要做什么。
Quid pro quo, yeah? I know you’ve scratched a few avatars off of my hit list.
这算是交换条件？\n我知道你已经帮我把几个化身，\n从我的“追杀名单”上划掉了。
Gonna be clear as crystal here: you’re doing better than most of the rangers.
这让我不得不说一句：\n你比大部分义军做得更好。
Such as the ones that recently just got mauled by a particularly ornery Steelix avatar.
比如某个最近刚被\n大钢蛇化身狠揍了一顿的人。
You know me so well. Put the thing in the ground – well, more in the ground.
你看来很懂我啊，\n把那个东西塞进地底...\n最好是塞进地心！
It’s ripping through the mine yard in <imp>Grouz</imp> at the moment, which is… a problem.
它现在正在<imp>古治镇</imp>的矿场里肆虐，\n这是个绝对的大麻烦。
If it goes down particular routes we could be facing a VERY uncomfortable situation.
如果它继续这样闹下去，\n我们会陷入非常糟糕的局面。
The rangers? Dealing with rampaging Tauros and crossroads hauntings.
你说义军？处理狂奔的肯泰罗\n和十字路口的幽灵。
Avatars are out of their paygrade. Not that we don’t send them in anyways and hope for the best.
化身并不属于他们的工作范畴，\n当然也不是说完全不管，\n只是他们并不擅长做这些。
Speaking of which: <imp>Grouz</imp>. Squad went out and didn’t leave a scratch on the damn thing.
说到这里：<imp>古治镇</imp>那边，\n义军小队也跟化身打了，\n但连一点划痕都没能造成。
You can split it right open, though, yeah?
你应该能解决掉它吧？
You don’t know what busy looks like, kid. You think I’m not trying to work here?
你知道真正的忙碌是什么吗？\n孩子，要不我们换换工作？
I know you cut a deal with Helena. Same here: you accelerate my timetable, I do the same for you.
我知道你跟海伦娜达成了协议，\n我这边也一样，你帮我，\n我也会帮你加快进度。
So make your way down to <imp>Grouz</imp> and turn that Steelix to slag. Please?
所以，去<imp>古治镇</imp>把那个\n钢铁巨虫轰成渣渣吧，靠你了。
I’ll check back in on you when I hear that behemoth’s gone. Promise I’ll make it worth your while, too.
等我听到任务完成的消息后，\n我会来找你的，\n必不会让你白白打工。
Capisce? Good. Bye.
没问题了吧？那就拜拜。
…She hung up.
…她挂断了。
Before you can put your phone away, it starts ringing again.
你还没来得及收起手机，\n铃声又响了起来。
It seems like an important call.
看起来是个很重要的电话。
\PN, I need your help. It’s urgent.
\PN，我需要你的帮助，紧急！
You know the <imp>catacombs</imp> under Prizca?
你知道宏礼市的<imp>地下墓穴</imp>吗？
There’s an entrance in the <imp>sewers</imp>. I need you here, now.
你可以通过<imp>下水道</imp>的入口进来，\n我在这里等你，快点！
I’ll explain when you get here – this isn’t the most secure way to communicate.
等你到了之后我再解释...\n电话通信算不上安全。
It’s bad, though. Real bad. I need a trainer of your caliber.
情况非常糟糕，非常非常糟糕！\n我需要你这样的训练家。
Thanks. I know this is sudden, but I can’t overstate how much I need your help ASAP.
谢谢，我知道很突然，\n但这边说成多么紧急都不过分。
Listen, kid, if I could call in a couple Chasm strike teams, I would.
听着，孩子，\n如果我能指望义军，早叫他们了。
But things change, and now all I have is you. You are NOT going to like the consequences if you don’t help me.
但是世事难料，现在只有你你，\n如果你不来，这个后果，\n我相信你也不会喜欢的。
Please.
拜托了。
Bring the best team you’ve got. It’s gonna get ugly.
带上你最强的宝可梦，\n这不是能简单应付的。
Hey, just checking in. What’s going on? Making progress?
嘿，日常检查，情况怎样？\n你不会一直没进展吧？
Oh, wow. Really trying your li’l heart out, aren’t you? More than one gym!
好家伙，你真是拼命了啊！\n打了不止一个道馆！
Ah, don’t get all broken up about it.
哈哈，别在意这种事。
You could be in the big city with six badges under your belt and it wouldn’t matter.
只要到了大城市这边，\n就能拿到六个徽章了。
Why, I never.
为什么？随便你。
Haven’t you heard blood’s thicker than water?
没听说过血浓于水吗？
Practically a type advantage.
这就是一种属性优势。
Well, whatever -- keep your secrets.
不过，随便你吧，\n保护好你的小秘密。
As for me, I’m taking a break before facing Noel.
至于我，打算在面对诺埃尔前，\n稍微休息一段时间。
You don’t know him -- and, let’s be honest, you probably never will -- but he’s kind of a big deal.
哦，你可能不知道他是谁...\n当然你可能永远都不会认识他，\n那可是个大人物。
So while you’re scuttling to and fro like a Falinks without an officer, I’ll be relaxing.
所以，当你什么时候，\n像个没有头头的列阵兵一样，\n四处瞎转悠的时候，\n我就可以放松一下咯。
Wish you were here!
真希望你就在这里啊！
He hung up…
他挂断了…
Wow, that was… a complete breeze.
哇，真是…轻而易举啊。
A joke, honestly.
当然，只是随便说说。
That’s my sixth badge now. You?
这是我的第六个徽章了，你呢？
Wow. I remember that.
哦，我记得那个。
Wait, how did you even schedule a challenge?
等下，你怎么预约到挑战的？
I made an appointment before I got on the ship.
我当时在船上的时候就预约了。
You... you're serious about this, aren't you?
你...你没糊弄我，对吧？
That can’t be right.
这不可能。
You’re better than that.
你肯定比这强。
Not by much, but if you’re lying, then… you’re taking this seriously. Huh.
你不可能菜成这样，\n不过，既然你在撒谎，也就是...\n你对这场竞争很认真嘛。
Hah! That never gets old.
哈，我猜也是这种回应。
You remind me of… I guess a Zangoose, right? So angry, but so normal.
你又让我想起了...\n那个猫鼬斩对吧？\n火气大得很，当然不是一般系那个。
But you are really angry, aren’t you?
但你火气真的很大不是吗？
Well, you’ve certainly made good time, but this is where things start getting harder.
哈哈，反正你的确赶上好时候了，\n现在，情况会变得越来越难。
You’ve still got a lot of ground to cover.
你还有很多事情要做。
See you at the championship!
竞技大会上见！
I’ll make sure to look in the stands for you.
我一定会帮你留意看台位置的。
He hung up… again.
他又挂了...
Hey, \PN. Things going well on your front?
喂，\PN。你那边进展如何？
Good. You’ve got eight badges now, right?
很好，你现在有八个徽章了对吧？
That’s... it’s something. You’ll excuse me if I’m not too preoccupied with the whole gym challenge shebang.
我这边可不像道馆挑战...\n已经忙得焦头烂额了。
That makes one of us.
那，我们就一样了。
Between the avatars and... recent developments... I’ve been swamped.
加在化身和...近期的事之间，\n我可是一直忙得不可开交。
Yeah, frickin’ tell me about it. I know exactly what you’re talking about, too.
是啊，我想你也知道是怎么回事。
Listen: I know the stress is probably getting to you, but we’re in the endgame now.
我知道你可能也很有压力，\n但我们已经快到尾声了。
Be a hero, become Champion, go home to Mavis. Everyone’s happy, right? Smiles all round.
成为英雄，成为冠军，\n回到梅维斯身边，\n让大家都开心地笑起来。
So, yeah, just a li’l bit longer.
所以...再成长一点就好了。
Take down those avatars if you can spare the time, come back to Prizca for the Championship, and... we’ll see about Yezera.
如果你能抽出时间，\n就去多解决几个化身吧，\n然后回宏礼市参加竞技大会，\n然后...再去处理叶泽拉的问题。
Thanks, \PN. I know it’s a lot.
谢了\PN，我知道事很多。
Thanks.
谢谢。
Whoever the hell it is helping Yezera, they’ve been making the rounds.
无论是谁在帮叶泽拉，\n他们一直在四处活动。
Good news is that you seem to be their priority. Haven’t been, y’know, rampaging. Which is good.
好消息是，你是他们的首要目标，\n这样你可以顺路解决一些问题。
I’ve had zero luck trying to track them down. I’d hire Alessa again if she’d return my calls – but, hey, that’s why I have you, right?
我不知道他们在什么地方。\n如果阿莱莎能再接电话的话，\n我还会再雇她做些什么...\n或许这就是我找上你的原因？
Yes and no. You’re gonna have to cut through some of the best trainers in the region, but it ain’t just busywork this time.
是，也不是，\n你得从本地区的训练家中拔得头筹，\n但这次不只是工作而已。
Not that it ever is – thanks, by the way – but this one should be especially interesting for you.
顺便说一句，谢谢...\n不过这次你会特别感兴趣的。
That’s what I like to hear. This ain’t gonna be an easy operation, but I trust in your abilities.
我就喜欢听你这么说，\n这次行动不会轻松，\n但我相信你的能力。
Mostly in committing violence. Lots of violence. Though, actually, maybe try talking this one out?
主要是得用暴力解决...\n一次接着一次地用暴力解决。\n当然，如果能说服他们最好不是吗？
You’re gonna want to hear this one. Trust me.
我觉得你想听我接下来的话。
I mean, you’ve got a minute before the Championship anyways. This op is... it’s pretty dire, importance- wise.
我的意思是说，\n反正你离冠军就差最后一步了，\n这次行动...重要性非常高。
I’ve got a confirmed sighting on Yezera. She’s back in her hometown – <imp>Whitebloom</imp>.
我确定看到叶泽拉回家了，\n我是说她老家 – <imp>白花镇</imp>.。
Yezera’s got a few titans on her and some kind of master plan, so she’s your first priority.
她身边还带着几个巨人，\n看起来有某种计划，\n再加上你是她的首要目标。
\PN... thanks in advance. Try and be understanding with Yezera. She’s... dealt with a lot.
\PN...我会提前向你表示感谢，\n试着去理解叶泽拉吧，\n她...承受了太多了。
But do what you have to do.
不过，按你自己的方式行动就好。
Do what you have to do, come back to Prizca for the tournament, and go home a Champion.
然后就做你该做的事情，\n来宏礼市参加竞技大会，\n再以冠军的身份回家。
Happy endings all-round, right?
皆大欢喜，对吧？
Right. Bye.
就这样了，拜。
Hey-o! Been a lil' bit but I managed to pry your number from Zain.
喂！很久不见了啊，\n不过我从赞恩那里要到了你的电话。
Sucks that I couldn't face you in the Tournament, but I've got a surprise to make up for it!
很遗憾没能在竞技大会上与你对决，\n但我这里有个惊喜可以弥补。
Heard about this place called the <imp>Battle Monument</imp>. It's for top trainers to battle.
你听过一个叫<imp>战斗纪念碑</imp>的地方吗？\n那是供顶级训练家对战的地方。
They're weird about directly inviting people, but you're a champion so you should just waltz right in. It'll be fine.
他们邀请的人都是一些高手，\n而且你是冠军，\n所以可以大摇大摆地进去。
I'll send the GPS coordinates to you so you can sail on over and give it a looksie.
我会把GPS坐标发给你，\n这样你就能开船去看看了。
Oh yeah, guess I didn't say before, but the Battle Monument is a big tower in the middle of the ocean.
哦，对了，我之前没说，\n战斗纪念碑是海中央的一座高塔。
If I didn't know better, I'd think it was some evil villainous lair.
如果不是事先了解的话，\n我会误以为那里是什么邪恶巢穴。
Anyways, I'll still be hanging around the Tournament grounds.
总之，我会在比赛场地周围转转。
There's still lots of trainers here, and I've got some new team configurations I really wanna try against them!
这里还有很多训练家，\n我也有新的队伍想要试试！
...
...
...Ok yeah someone here just asked to battle me, and I'm not gonna turn that down, so I gotta end the call now.
...呃...有人来跟我对战了，\n我不可能拒绝这个机会，\n所以我要挂断了。
Hope you're doing well, be safe, make good choices, have fun, et cetera. Bye bye!
希望你们一切顺利，注意安全，\n然后做出正确的选择，并玩得开心。\n再见咯！
…They hung up.
…挂断了。
They must really want to talk with you.
他们一定想和你谈谈。
A couple seconds later, you receive a text message with the coordinates to the Battle Monument.
几秒钟后，你收到了短信，\n上面有战斗纪念碑的坐标。
Hello to you, young one.
你好啊，年轻人。
It is I, Dr. Hekata.
我是经方博士。
Do not worry about how I learned of your cellphone number. I simply divined it.
我怎么知道你手机号码的？\n别担心，只是猜到了而已。
I have a topic to discuss of some importance.
我只是有件事要跟你说。
I beseech you—<imp>visit my abode in Grouz</imp>. There we shall discuss.
就当是我的恳求了...\n<imp>来我在古治镇的住所</imp>面谈吧。
Apologies for the interruption to your adventure, young master.
抱歉打断你的冒险之旅，少主。
However, given that you've sent a number of Pokemon to Storage, I thought it best that I inform you of my project.
由于您寄送了很多的宝可梦，\n我觉得还是要跟您说一下我的计划。
To make it short: Your family owns an unused Estate here in Makya.
让我们长话短说 - \n您名下有一处在马凯亚的庄园。
Since you're taking on the Makyan Gym Challenge, I took the initiative to renovate the grounds for our use.
由于之前一直处于弃置状态，\n所以我在听说您要来这边\n进行道馆挑战之后，\n便自作主张将其修缮了一番。
I've set up a system that sends the Pokemon you store in your PC to this <imp>PokÉstate</imp>.
这是我所写的一个程序系统，\n您可以将存储在电脑中的宝可梦\n送到这座<imp>庄园</imp>里休憩。
I'll take care of them there while you are busy with your journey.
当您忙于旅途时，\n我会在那里好好照看它们。
I love Pokemon variety, so I've prepared lots of <imp>EXP Candy</imp> to give you as your collection grows.
随着庄园里的宝可梦种类越来越多，\n我也可以给您提供一些<imp>经验糖果</imp>，\n帮助您完成这次的旅程。
Once you've earned some, I'll send them to you through the PC.
我会将它们寄存在电脑中，\n您可以随时取用。
I'll continue to wait for you on the boat. If you want to visit the PokÉstate, send me a ping at any PC.
我会继续在船上等您，\n如果您想要前往庄园，\n只需要用电脑发消息给我就好。
I'll take you there immediately.
我会立即带您前往那里。
That is all. I will distract you no further, young master.
大概就这样了，最后再次致歉，\n抱歉打断了您的旅程，少主，\n祝您接下来一切都顺利。
\i[TAROTAMULET]The Tarot Amulet spasms like something dying.
\i[塔罗护符]这个塔罗护符就像一个\n病入膏肓的人一样在痉挛着...
You feel your pupils dilate and somewhere bleak and broken almost comes into view at the corners of your vision.
你的瞳孔逐渐放大，\n视野中出现了一个荒凉破败的地方。
A woman’s voice whispers from that place – almost familiar, but not quite.
一个女人正在那里喃喃自语...\n那声音即熟悉，又感到陌生。
You shouldn’t have reversed that amulet, dearest.
你不该把护身符反过来的，\n亲爱的。
The woman who gave it to you was trying to protect you.
把它给你的女人是想保护你。
Now, though, charms for safe beginnings turn to invitations of dire endings.
但现在，安全旅程的魅力，\n变成了可怕结局的邀约。
Maybe there’s something to learn from interlacing your journey with the path of ordeals, though.
不过，将你的旅程与磨难交织在一起，\n或许还能学到更多的东西。
Enjoy this brief, bitter taste of the end, darling, and I’ll try and pull some strings should you prove victorious.
享受这短暂而苦涩的结局吧，\n如果你赢了，亲爱的，\n我会想办法帮助你的。
\i[TAROTAMULET]Once again the amulet twitches.
\i[塔罗护符]护符再次抽搐起来。
Once again, you can almost make something out, just past your peripheral vision.
你又一次在视野之外，\n仿佛看到了什么东西。
Once again, she speaks.
是她，她又说话了。
Oh? You’re back, dearest. Lovely.
亲爱的，你回来了，真可爱。
These people are tied inextricably to this region’s secrets; its conspiracies.
这些人与这个地区\n的秘密和阴谋密不可分。
Let me implant a bit of my demesne into theirs, and I might be able to tease them open like a faulty lock.
让我把自己的领地植入其中，\n或许能像打开一把坏锁一样，\n将一切变得透亮。
You want to know more, don’t you? Want them to trust you?
你也想知道更多对吧？\n你希望他们能信任你？
Then prepare to enjoy another trial.
那就准备享受另一场审判吧。
\i[TAROTAMULET]It’s the amulet again.
\i[塔罗护符]又是护身符。
It isn’t the thing itself that’s in pain. No, something else is – something larger.
痛苦的不是事物本身，\n是别的...更大的东西。
Something is wrong in this region.
这个地区出问题了。
Another challenge, another opportunity.
又一个挑战，又一个机遇。
I never put much stock into mysticism until my hand was forced. I’m so glad to see my investment paying dividends.
在我被逼无奈之前，\n从来不相信所为的神秘主义，\n但现在很高兴看到，\n自己的投资得到了回报。
These people don’t even know I’m threading their fate through yours!
这些人甚至都不知道，\n我把他们的命运，\n与你的命运紧紧连在一起了！
I paint an impressed expression on their malleable faces – so long as you can walk the walk.
我在他们那可塑性很强的脸上，\n画上了印象深刻的表情...\n当然，只有你能做到。
Go on, dearest. You know the rules by now.
去吧，亲爱的，\n你现在已经知道规矩了。
\i[TAROTAMULET]The reversed amulet spasms and the other place impends on you.
\i[塔罗护符]护符再次痉挛，\n又有一个地方逼近你了。
That voice… it’s painfully familiar.
那声音...熟悉地令人心痛。
Oh, you already know who I am, child.
哦，你已经知道我是谁了，孩子。
I’m the one that’s waiting for you at the end of the line. The end of your line… and of every line.
我就是那个在终点等你的人...\n即是你的终点，\n也是整条线路的终点。
Makya is a place rich in history.
马凯亚是个历史悠久的地方。
That’s why you endure these tastes of my demesne, isn’t it? To learn history?
你在学习这里的历史吗？\n这就是你忍受我的原因对吧？
Well, even history ends. You’ll understand eventually.
好吧，即便历史就此终结，\n你也能最终明白。
Go on. Show me what a conqueror you are, darling.
继续吧，亲爱的，\n让我看看你是个怎样的征服者。
\i[TAROTAMULET]At this point, you can almost hear fate whimpering through the amulet.
\i[塔罗护符]此时此刻，\n你几乎可以通过护身符，\n听到命运的呜咽。
Her voice shushes it, but does not comfort it.
她在安慰它，却没有安慰的语调。
Where did Imogene get this thing? I doubt she realized the significance of the sliver of stone she implanted within this amulet.
伊莫珍是从哪儿弄到它的？\n我猜她根本没有理解，\n在这里面植入那块石头的意义。
It was uplifted from a forbidden place where history is tortuous and frayed.
那时从历史曲折的禁地中升起的。
Its latent power, the witch’s arcana, and, of course, my… expertise… all aligned to make my little bits of influence possible.
潜藏着力量、奥术，\n当然还有我自己的专长...\n所有这些结合起来后，\n让我的影响力一点点变成可能。
I hope you feel lucky, darling: you are.
我希望你能意识到自己的幸运，\n亲爱的。
Always.
你永远都是幸运的。
\i[TAROTAMULET].....
\i[塔罗护符].....
There’s something calming about the hellscape you can almost perceive.
你几乎可以感知到地狱般的景象。
It’s a calm hell; quiet and somber.
那时一个平静、沉寂的地狱。
Her voice is much the same.
她的声音也是如此。
If only I could twist these gym leaders’ roles without having to suffuse their arenas with my demesne and all its… antipathy.
如果我可以改变这些道馆馆主，\n让他们的道馆不至于充满我的领地...\n那该有多好。
History ends quietly, but not kindly.
历史的结局是平静的，\n但并不美好。
Here, our day-to-day lives are much like what you endure in these battles.
在这里，我们的日常生活，\n就像你们在战斗中经历的一样。
Oh, don’t pity me. My only point is that I would gladly spare you the intensity of fate’s dying gasps if I could, trust me.
哦，不用可怜我，\n我唯一想说的就是，\n如果可以，我很乐意让你，\n免受命运临终前的剧烈喘息。
Trust me, darling.
相信我，亲爱的。
\i[TAROTAMULET]As the amulet twists and writhes, you can feel the tension of invisible threads being pulled taut.
\i[塔罗护符]随着护身符的扭曲和蠕动，\n你感受到无形的丝线被绷到了最紧。
They are wrapped around the amulet, and around you.
它们缠绕着护身符，\n也同样缠绕着你。
Somewhere behind you they frayed into thousands of strands, and ahead of you they extend to somewhere distant.
在你身后的某处，\n它们成千上万，细如发丝；\n在你身前的某处，\n它们交织绵延，直至天际。
There they all end.
最终在这里结束。
You understand by now, don’t you? Makya is history.
你现在明白了吧？\n马凯亚已经成为了历史。
You, darling, are a history to me – a singular history.
亲爱的，你对我来说也是...\n是一段独特的历史。
And I am a singular history projected forward.
我是一段向前投射的独特历史。
You have the benefit of what we’ll call a privileged reference frame, and I thank you dearly for letting me glimpse through your eyes at it.
你拥有我们称为特权的优势，\n感谢你让我通过你的眼睛看到它。
Not to mention making a few… alterations.
更不用说...改动些许了。
Don’t think too hard on it, dearest.
别想太多，亲爱的。
\i[TAROTAMULET]The amulet has gone still.
\i[塔罗护符]护身符不见了。
Something is changing – the threads are being woven back together, or severed, or both.
有些东西正在发生变化...\n丝线正在重新编织在一起，\n又或者被重新切断。
Someone is taking matters into their own hands.
有人正在自作主张。
No, that isn’t me.
不，那不是我。
We both know who it is, though, don’t we?
我们都知道是谁，对吧？
You should probably stop her from doing that, or one of us could end up in the other’s place.
你也许应该阻止她这样做，\n否则我们中的一个，\n可能会在对方的位置上就此终结。
You were not made for the terminus, and I was not made for a utopia.
你不是为了终结而生，\n我也不是为了美好而生。
And no human was made for the paradise she’s planning.
没有谁是为了她的天堂而生。
…\PN, you know who I am, don’t you?
…\PN，你知道我是谁对吧？
We won’t be speaking for a little while, but know that I’m watching over you, child.
接下来我们有段时间没法再交流了，\n但我会看着你，孩子。
My child.
我的孩子。

You got to wonder where all this circuitry came from... It feels natural, but it obviously isn't.
你想不想知道这些电路是怎么来的？\n看起来就跟自然而然\n出现在这里的一样。
Ugh, glad my shift is over. This place gives me the heebie jeebies.
唉，终于下班了，\n这地方让我毛骨悚然。
Obviously Team Chasm had something to do with it, but I don't get paid to ask those kind of questions.
显然这些都跟裂隙队有关，\n但我既然拿了工资，就不会多问。
Do you think you could run a video game on this cave system?
你觉得这里的电路系统\n能接一台游戏机吗？
Electric bikes rule! All the other punks don't know what they're missing out on!

I'm amped up after that one kid, but my bike isn't. Guess, I'll just walk.

怎么，一个人的时候就不能\n安安静静地骑着电动车装13吗？

Hey champ, how's it hanging?
嘿冠军，最近怎么样?
Recently got a few uhh... assets, that I'm looking to sell. Fell off of a Trainer's backpack.
最近搞到了点...好货，\n都是从训练家的背包掉出来的，\n我想把它们出手掉。
I'm a nice guy, so I'll give you a nice price.
我这个人很好说话的，\n所以我会给你个合适的价钱。
You got $5000 on you? I've got a Numel with your name on it if so.
$5000有吗？要是有的话，\n这只呆火驼身上就写你名字了。
You sure? You ain't gonna find a deal like this again.
确定？\n过了这个村可就没这个店了。
Heh, pleasure doing business with ya.
呵呵，很高兴和你做生意。
\PN hands over $5000 in exchange.
\PN 交给对方 $5000。
Well, gotta hit the road. Cash is only useful if you spend it, ya know.

You missing the cash? Hmm.
唔，你说你手头紧？
You've... got your own set of problems, huh?
你…你也有自己的难处吧?
Oh… you destroyed it.
啊…你把它干掉了。
I was watching that avatar, and you just… dismissed it.
我正在观察那个化身，\n可是你给它...唉...
Well, it couldn’t last forever.
也是，它也不可能一直存在下去。
Nice to meet you. My name’s <imp>Skyler</imp>.
自我介绍一下，我是<imp>斯凯勒</imp>。
You were superb, by the way. Fought like the sun against the morning mist.
你刚刚的表现\n就如刺穿晨雾的阳光一般耀眼。
And, I suppose I can’t complain. I can leave now, at the very least.
我也没什么可抱怨的。\n至少现在可以离开这里了。
Skyler.
斯凯勒。
I don’t know what else you want me to say. I’m a traveler on a pilgrimage of sorts, which I can now continue.
我不知道你还想让我说什么，\n我只是一个正踏在朝圣之路上，\n并将继续走下去的旅者而已。
All thanks to you, of course.
当然，多亏了你我才能继续前进。
I’d opted to take a short nap before continuing my pilgrimage.
在朝圣的旅途中，\n我也需要在路边小睡一会儿。
Hah. Bit of a mistake. The avatar showed up while I was sleeping, not that I minded.
哈哈，所以那个化身，\n是在我睡觉时出现的，\n不过我倒是不怎么介意。
Makya’s a beautiful region, full of beautiful people. But I’m going to admit that I’m here for the avatars.
马凯亚是个美丽的地区，\n有着各种各样美丽的人们，\n不过我来这里就是为了这些化身。
Everyone’s concerned with how dangerous they are, but I think they’re missing the point.
所有人都只考虑自己的安危，\n我认为他们忽略了最重要的事。
We’ve gotten jaded. Pokémon used to be magical. We used to worship them. I think we’ve forgotten that.
我们变得麻木了，傲慢了。\n宝可梦是多么奇妙的存在，\n那时我们对它们尊之敬之。\n但现在的人们却遗忘了这一点。
So are you! Look how you fought!
你也跟他们一样！\n看看你战斗的样子就能明白了！
But I’m interested in you nonetheless. Call it a dangerous obsession or a leap of faith – your pick.
但无论现在你怎么想，\n我都对你很感兴趣。\n至于是危险的执念还是信仰升华，\n那要看你自己的想法如何变化了。
But were they always? You’ve heard legends of Pokémon raising mountains and oceans.
但它们一直都是现在这样吗？\n你应该也听说过那些传说吧？
We were created by Pokémon, and they’ll be the end of us someday.
我们人类是宝可梦创造的，\n也总有一天，它们会毁灭我们。
At least, that’s what they say of Arceus and Yveltal, not to mention all the rest.
这是人们对阿尔宙斯\n和伊裴尔塔尔的描述和看法，\n更何况传说中可不只有这两位。
I’m glad to hear you agree.
很高兴我们拥有共识。
Maybe it’s a foolish endeavor, seeking these things out. I’m sure they’d maul me given half a chance.
也许去寻找这些化身\n是种愚蠢的尝试，\n我敢肯定只要有机会，\n它们就会将我们撕成碎片。
But maybe reverence, not fear, is what they’re looking for.
但我在想有没有可能，它们要的，\n是敬畏，而并非恐惧。
In any case, I’m glad I met you. Technically, I suppose you saved me.
总之，很高兴认识你，\n严格意义上，也是你救了我。
I’ll be back on my little journey now, but, uh, I’ll see you again.
我要继续旅程了，\n不过，我们会再见的。
A trainer like you must be seeking badges, right? So let’s meet in the <imp>town ruined by avatars</imp>.
像你这样的训练家\n一定是在收集徽章吧？\n那么，<imp>被化身摧毁的小镇见</imp>。
I hear there’s a gym leader there. So long, my knight in shining armor.
听说那里就有一位道馆馆主，\n就此别过，耀眼的骑士。
My grandpapa gave me this Tranquill. He's in the ground now. Wanna fight?
这只咕咕鸽是爷爷给我的礼物，\n现在他不在，我们打一架吧！
Welp, I've gotta go! Grandpapa's gonna give me a tour of the mines today!
好吧，我也得走了！\n爷爷说今天要带我参观矿山!
Tranquill! No! Use your Tranquill powers! ...oh.
不！咕咕鸽！\n快使用你的鸽之力！
Swirlix goes bye-bye...

You with the rangers? Ah, doesn't matter. No one's nabbing our haul!
你是义军那边的？\n哈，无所谓了，\n反正没人能抢走我们的战利品！
I swear, if our fourth was here, we'd kick your teeth in! Where'd that chick run off to, anyways? She needs some teeth-kicking too...
要是我们第四个队友在这里，\n肯定能把你打得满地找牙！\n那小妞到底跑哪去了？\n也太无组织无纪律了…
I've taken worse! If you think I'm done protecting the boss, you don't know me!
我什么局面没见过啊？\n你别以为我就这么放弃了，\n小瞧人也是有限度的！
Makya's one of the few regions where creative archaeology is still legal. You're kinda lookin' like competition.
马凯亚是目前为数不多，\n仍允许进行考古创新研究的地区。\n你...莫不是竞争对手？
Maybe that's my cue to try a different tactic. I gotta be more subtle than challenging random strangers...
这或许是让我尝试不同策略的预警，\n看来以后得更加谨慎地行事了...
Well ain't that a cryin' shame. Guess Makya's a bit rougher than I thought...
真是令人悲愤的耻辱感啊。\n看来马凯亚比我想象中更棘手...
Excuse me! We were about to settle this in battle.
不好意思，我们两个本打算\n通过战斗来解决问题的。
But, fine, I guess we can find common ground in disposing of you.
但是现在，我觉得可以\n在先除掉你这件事上达成共识。
...Hmph. Very well. I suppose brute force is your people's specialty. Follow my lead.
哼...很好。\n看来你的强项就是蛮力？\n那就试试看吧。
Bah! I have nothing left, and now she is free to waltz on in to the College. Is that what you wanted?
嘿！你把我的宝可梦都打败了，\n这样我就没法阻止她进入学校了，\n这就是你的目的？
No, you know what? I'm leaving.
谁稀罕？我要走了！
The only way I'm coming back is if it's with my dad and a few of his friends.
我会带着我爸爸和几个朋友，\n一块来讨个公道的！
I knew who you were the second I saw your last name on the role sheet.
哼，一听到你的姓，\n我就知道你是谁了。
The last time I heard it, it had "Lieutenant" in front of it.
上次听到这个姓的时候，\n后面还带着“中尉”两个字。
If only you'd inherited some of his prowess in battle, you might've made it past me. Go then, and don't come back.
哪怕只继承他一小部分实力，\n你也早就大白我了。\n所以滚吧，别丢人现眼了！
Urgh... oh, shove off, why don't you?
啊啊啊啊...\n你这人怎么这么碍事？
You too, you old hag.
还有你，碍事的老太婆！
I think you'll find me back here so long as you keep trying to gain entrance, you entitled brat.
不管你以后来多少次，\n我都会在这里挡住你的去路，\n自以为是的小鬼！
Those Evolution Stones are all ours! You can't have any!
那些进化石都是我们的！\n你一个也别想带走！
Aagh! Fine! I'll leave! I've got my evolutions, anyways.
啊啊！行吧！我走我走！\n反正我已经拿到想要的进化石了。
...I'll be back. I'll be back, and if I ever see you again, things're gonna be different. I swear I'll...
...我一定会回来的。\n下次再见到你，一切都会不同。\n我发誓...我一定会...
I refuse to let someone like her into the Academy.
我不会允许她这样的人入学的。
We have enough of her sort at the Academy as it stands...

Yo...so I heard there was like, some items to steal on this route?
听说这是一条适合偷道具的路？
I got nothin' to say. You good at battling.
我无话可说，\n你很擅长对战。
Bruh. Ok then, I guess.
我觉得，差不多吧。
The berry plant is growing.
树果还在生长中。
Listen, kid, I'm gonna give you one last warning: you can either hit the road, or bite the dust. No? Fine. We'll do it the hard way.
听着，小鬼，最后一次警告：\n要么滚蛋要么死！\n什么？好吧。那我们就用硬的。
Hah, well, you win some, you lose some. I'm not so broken up about it.
哈，好吧，有赢有输，\n也不是不能接受。
Helena can't afford proper guards for LuxTech's shipments, so there'll always be business for me. See you around, hero.
海莲娜请不起称职的警卫\n来看管光华的货物，\n所以我一直都有生意可做。\n回头见了，小英雄。
C'mon, kid. We're not giving up on this little nook unless we have to... and I'm not scared of your little posse.
来吧，小鬼。除非万不得已，\n否则我们不会放弃这个地方…\n而且我也不怕你们这群人。

我为了研究地磁性质课题，\n从阿罗拉进口了这些小拳石，\n但是我刚把它们放出来，\n那个化身就出现了！
I don't know what to do, it's made the Geodudes go into a frenzy!
我不知道该怎么办，\n它让小拳石们都疯了！
If you could defeat it for me, I'll be waiting over here.
你能帮我打败它吗？\n我实在解决不了这种问题。
If you could defeat the avatar over there for me, I'll be waiting here.
你能帮我击败那里的化身吗？\n我实在解决不了这种问题。
Goodness me, thank you. Here, take this Geodude.
天哪，谢谢你。\n来，这只小拳石给你了。
You not only deserve a reward, but my hypothesis is that the avatar appeared when I had so many together in one place....
这是你应得的，\n另外我怀疑是不是\n有太多小拳石聚集在一起，\n才导致了化身的出现...
My hypothesis is that the avatar appeared when I had too many Alolan Geodudes together in one place....

I really wish the vendor here would sell coffee.
真希望这里的商店能卖咖啡。
There's a high demand for it, and no one wants to walk through an entire cave just to visit the cafe in Novo Town.
这里的大家对咖啡的需求量很大，\n总不能天天为了买咖啡，\n还要穿过山洞去望新镇吧？
I was supposed to have a meeting with Kurt today about gracefully decommissioning some of the cluster, but he never showed up.
我今天本来要跟库特开个会，\n讨论如何从容地退役回家，\n但他一直都没来。
Doesn’t he know that maintaining legacy systems adds unnecessary fragility?
难道他理解不了\n维护过去只会让一切变得更脆弱吗？
You and Helena had something secretive to discuss, is that it?
听说你和海莲娜有秘密要谈?
I'd love to ask, but, well, I need this job more than I need to satisfy my curiosity.
我很想问，但是，\n比起满足我的好奇心，\n能留住这份工作更重要。
Either way, that was a great battle!
不管怎样，\n那都是一场精彩的战斗！

I'm gonna show you the difference between strategy and tactics!

Just like that, my team's put to the sidelines.

A knack for tactics, that's what you got. Helena'll be impressed, I know it.
这就是你的战斗诀窍？\n海伦娜一定会对你刮目相看的。
Healing center's uhh... to the west. So go off and do that now.
治疗中心呃...在西边，\n现在就去吧。
She just switches around a lot? That's the "tactics" everyone around here's been hyping up?
她只是在频繁的换宝可梦？\n这就是他们鼓吹的“战术”？
I'm a bit dissapointed. Well, let's avoid getting too cocky. I should actually make my attempt before judging.
我有点失望...\n不过，也不能太自大了，\n我应该先试试，再做判断才对。

You ever have someone bother you out of nowhere?
你有没有被莫名其妙地打扰过?
Just have your Pokemon give 'em one of these, and they'll leave you alone quick.
只要让你的宝可梦学会这个，\n他们就会主动远离你了。
Yeah, that'll do.
没错，这样就行了。
Either you give 'em one of those, or you bribe 'em with some stuff you don't need.
要么给他们来一记这样的招式，\n要么用你不需要的东西贿赂他们。

海伦娜不仅要担任公司的决策层，\n还得为马凯亚政府提供各种协助，\n即便如此，她也能抽出自己的时间，\n为道馆训练手下的宝可梦。

如果你打算挑战她，\n一定要提防她的“打了就跑”战术。
Most of her Pokemon use switch-out moves: Flip Turn, Volt Switch, or U-Turn.
她大部分宝可梦都会类似于\n快速折返，伏特替换之类的招式。
If you want a leg up, hazards like Stealth Rocks and Spikes can help a lot.

In theory, they're thoroughly vetting all hires for past Chasm ties, and Helena's just an advisor... but we all know she's running the show.
上面一直监视着有裂隙队背景的人，\n虽说以前海伦娜名义上只是顾问...\n但大家都知道，她其实是管理层。
Not a good look for the company that recently switched mottos to "Innovation, Inspiration, Integrity."

我的考试参考书\n又一次在路上被偷光了！
Apparently not everyone got the memo that Makya shouldn't work that way anymore.
显然即便到了今天，\n马凯亚的治安依然问题不小。
I really hope that Helena can convince the Makyan Rangers to start patrolling our routes.
我真希望海伦娜能要求义军，\n在我常走的几条路上巡逻。
Don't give coffee.

Sure, let's go.
好，来吧

The Growlithe is cowering from everything.
卡蒂狗好像很害怕。
You notice a tag on its collar. Though it's moving around, you can just make out what's written on it.
你注意到它的领子上有个标签，\n虽然它一直动来动去，\n但你还是能看清上面的字。
Its owner apparently lives in Novo Apartments, in Novo Town.

Oh! It's the lost Growlithe you were told about.

Remembering the instructions you were given, you pull a Milk Bone Treat from your bag.

You hand the treat to the Growlithe. After a quick sniff, it eats the treat.

You want to know how my makeup stays fresh with all this ash?
你想知道在这种环境\n怎么保持妆容的吗？
The truth is that I am... a beast of the forest, come to take your soul!
其实我是...沼泽妖怪，\n来取走你的灵魂! 
But, seriously, you don't want to know how this stuff stays on.
但是说真的，\n你肯定不想知道\n这东西是怎么贴在脸上的。
And with that mystery left alluringly open, I will take my leave.
你就自己考虑下这个答案吧，\n告辞咯！
Hahaha! You should've seen your face! It was so... you.

The berry plant is growing.
树果还在生长中。
Fighting alongside a Voltorb is a dangerous game, but I dribble nonetheless. It is my fate.
与霹雳电球并肩作战\n是一场危险的游戏，\n但我不会改变自己的想法，\n这，即是我的命运。
One day my children will ask me if I, too, had teachers, and I will say everyone who reminds me I don't explode regularly is my teacher.
总有一天，我的孩子也会问我，\n“我的启蒙老师是谁，”\n我会告诉他，每个提醒我\n不要总发脾气的人都是我的老师。
This was not a failure, for I am unexploded, and every unexploded day is a blessing.
这不是失败，\n因为我还没爆炸，\n每个没有爆炸的日子\n都是上天给我的恩赐。
My last batch of mushrooms went rancid.
我之前采的蘑菇都馊了。
Which stinks!
完了个蛋！
Well, to tell you the truth, I couldn't smell the difference.
说实话，\n我倒是闻不出什么不对来。
So I need to get meself acquainted with the smell of healthy mushrooms.
看来我得熟悉一下，\n新鲜的蘑菇是什么味道。
Could you do me a favor and bring me a mushroom Pokemon so I can get me a whiff?
那你能帮我个忙，\n帮我带一只蘑菇宝可梦来闻闻吗？
I don't have much in the way of rewards.
我...没什么可以给你的。
Suppose I could give ya what I confiscated from my nephew.
要不就把没收我侄子的\n那个东西给你吧。
He crafted something mighty gross outta my failed harvest.

Just what the Nurse Joy ordered!
乔伊小姐说的就是这个！
Appreciate it. Now, lemme get this over with.

这位农场主正在猛吸你的宝可梦。
Hah...I can see it now. The cash rollin' in from a full healthy harvest.
哈...我看到了！\n丰收的喜悦正在翻涌！
Anyways, my side of the bargain...
总之，我之前说的...
Suppose I'll get outta yer hair now.
现在我该走了。
The true self can only be found by exploring the world, and beating the crap out of random people you find on the way!
只有通过探索世界，\n痛殴路上的训练家，\n才能实现真正的自我！
After that thrashing I'm gonna have to self-actualize extra-violently to make up! See ya in Kalos!
在挨了那顿揍之后，\n我要更加暴力地\n去弥补自我的实现！\n我们在卡洛斯再见！
Ah, a fellow seeker of enlightenment. Best of luck!
啊，一位追求觉悟的同道！\n祝你好运! 
This is a premiere Bug-type training ground! Samorn told me herself!
赛蒙告诉我说，\n这里非常适合训练虫系宝可梦！
Maybe I'm the worm...
或许我才是那只虫子...
Down but not out! The true power of the Bug-type!
败而不倒，\n这才是虫属性真正的力量! 
Samorn trains Dragon-types as well! How cool is that!
赛蒙竟然同时训练龙属性！\n这真是太酷啦！
Not as cool as bugs though.

I saw a band of troubadours in that cave beyond the fence.
我看到一些穿着奇怪的演员\n进到那个被围着栅栏的洞里了。
Do you know anything about them?
你知道他们在干什么吗？
I heard boisterous exclamations of wonder.
我听到了一些奇怪的声音。
It's ever so compelling, don't you agree?
你也注意到了，对吧？
Maybe they're up to something...something suspicious?
或许他们...有什么阴谋？
No
没
Yes
找到了
[Map8]
Hey there. Miss me?
嘿，想我了吗？
I finally got here – all thanks to you. I have to say, you don’t look a mite worse for wear considering how much wilderness you trekked through.
终于到地方了...\n再次感谢你之前帮我脱困。\n不过我很意外，穿过了一大片沼泽，\n你看起来却并无疲惫感。
I can’t cope as well as you can – I need a hot bath and soon.
没想到你竟然这么强...\n我不行，我得找地方洗个热水澡。
This is the place to be if one’s looking for avatars, or so I heard.
我听说这里是寻找化身的好去处。
I must have heard right, because I’ve already found more than I can count on both hands.
显然这并不是谣言，\n来到这边之后，\n我见到的化身已经超过两手之数了。
Are you in a rush?
你在赶时间？
All business and no pleasure might not make you dull, but it does make you a bore.
如果人没有时间娱乐，\n早晚有时间生病。
So come on – we’re young and free. You can take a few minutes off, can’t you?
尽请挥霍年轻带来的自由吧，\n在这里歇歇脚不好吗？
Skyler, at your service. We met back in the grassland, between a few avatars.
我是斯凯勒，\n之前在草地那边见过，\n当时旁边还有一个化身。
The sun and moon were smiling on us, you came to my rescue…
当日月都对我露出微笑时，\n是你来救我于水火之中...
I could exaggerate further but the truth is striking enough.
我可以用更夸张的方式\n形容我们之间的相遇，\n不过事实就已经很梦幻了。
But enough about the two of us. Let’s talk about the specters roaming the town.
关于我们的事情，\n差不多就聊到这里吧，\n现在说说这镇子上的幽灵。
They’re so… arrogant. Have you ever noticed that?
你注意到了吗？\n它们简直...太傲慢了。
They just don’t care about us fleshy creatures – human or Pokémon. All they seem to notice is the land, each other, and a few very specific objects.
它们根本不在乎\n我们这些还拥有血肉的生物，\n它们似乎只在意彼此的领土，\n以及某些极为特殊的东西。
I know this asking a lot, but… can I borrow a Moon Stone from you?
我知道这个要求很过分，\n但我…能问你借一块月之石吗?
The avatars seem to notice the incredible power inside those stones.
化身们似乎注意到了\n进化石中蕴含的惊人力量。
Unless you’re asking me why a Moon Stone, in which case, well, I decided apropos of nothing.
至于为什么是月之石...\n好吧，我随便选的。
That’s not entirely true – I don’t want to offend them with a clashing element.
倒也不是完全随意选的...\n我不想用相冲的能量激怒它们。
Fire, Water, Sun, the like. And Moon just fits the ambience.
像是火、水、太阳那些...\n月亮刚好符合这个氛围。
Safe bet, hmm? So if you have one to spare, please let me know. I’ll pay you back with interest later.
这是个很安全的决策，对吧？\n所以如果你可以借我，\n那么将来，我会连本带利还给你的。 
Ah, fair. I am bringing business into pleasure again, aren’t I? I’m horribly bad at this.
啊，也对。\n我又把工作和私人生活搞混了，\n我也对自己这个问题很头疼。
Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me.
如果改变主意了，\n你知道到哪里能找到我。 
I assure you, I’ll pay you back eventually, plus extra.
我向你保证，\n将来会连本带利还给你的。 
Well that was quick. Honestly, you shouldn’t be so generous! Someone could take advantage of that.
嗯？这么爽快？\n老实说，你不该那么大方，\n很容易被别人利用的。
I’ve never turned down someone’s hospitality, especially someone like you, but take a minute.
我从不拒绝别人的好意，\n特别是你，但请先思索一下。
Think about it. I’ll make sure to pay you back, but don’t rush into this.
思索一下是否要\n借给我这么贵重的物品。\n当然我肯定会还给你的，\n但请不要随随便便做出决定。
So, care to part with a Moon Stone?
那么，\n你能把一颗月之石借给我吗？
Just come to see me, then? I appreciate it – and I appreciate seeing you, too.
也就是说，你是来看我的？\n我真的很高兴。
You’ll have to teach me how you stay so composed in places like this. Sometime later, hmm?
晚些时候，\n能不能教教我\n怎么在这种地方保持淡定，好吗？
You hand over the Moon Stone.
你将月之石交给他。
Thank you very much. I understand these are valuable, even leaving evolution out of the picture.
真的太感谢了，\n我知道，即便你不需要它，\n它的价值也不会因此降低。
If one of your Pokémon passed up evolution for this, give them my regards.
如果你的宝可\n梦因此放弃了进化的机会，\n那请代我谢谢它。
I’ll be sure to tell you the results of this offering next we meet.
再次见面时，\n我肯定会给你带来好消息的。
And repay you, of course! What do you say to dinner? There’s a place in <imp>Prizca East</imp>.
当然是报答你啦！\n请你吃顿晚饭咋样？\n<imp>东宏礼市</imp>的美食挺不错的。
Well, you can think on it – I need to track down an avatar, and you need to beat some gym leaders.
不过现在，是时候行动了...\n我得去追踪一个化身，\n而你得打败一些道馆馆主。
Until we meet again.
下次再会。 
I hate to be a spoilsport, but, uh, that isn’t a Moon Stone.
我实在不想扫你的兴，\n可这不是月之石。
I appreciate the effort, trust me – you’re very generous. I just can’t work with it, though. You keep it.
我很感激你的心意...\n你真的很大方。\n只是这个对我来说没什么用，\n你还是自己留着吧。 
Avatars seem to care about these stones.
化身似乎对这些石头很感兴趣。
I want to see if I can’t make an offering. Perhaps placate them?
我想试着能不能用这种方式，\n安抚一下它们的情绪？
And a Moon Stone seems the least likely to offend the ones here in Velenz.
在夜幽市这种地方，\n月之石应该不会冒犯到它们。
Something like a Fire or Sun Stone would clash, and a Leaf or Dusk Stone is more of what they already have.
而火之石、日之石这些\n就跟这里的气氛相冲了，\n至于叶之石或暗之石...\n貌似它们已经有了。
I promise it’s a good cause.
我相信自己的判断没错
A notice about the Makyan Regional Tournament has been hastily scribbled over.
一张关于马凯亚竞技大会的通知，\n被潦草地涂抹后扔掉了。
A note added below reads "Not Taking Challengers"
下面增加了一行注释：\n"不接受挑战者"
Velenz Gym
夜幽道馆
Leader: Rafael
馆主：拉斐尔

It seems like the Gym Leader was supposed to write a title here, but the space has been left blank.
按照惯例，\n馆主应该在最后一行写些什么，\n但这里被空出来了。
Temporary Velenz Ranger Outpost
夜幽市临时义军哨所
"Velenz, proud home of-"
"夜幽市，我骄傲的故..."
Claw marks on the sign render the text unreadable.
上面的字迹被爪痕破坏得难以识别。
I thought this place was supposed to be scary.
我以为这地方会很可怕。
Just seems peaceful to me.
只不过是比别处安静罢了。
Eek! You're the scary one here!
哎呀！你才是最可怕的!
I'm afraid of bugs, but not ghosts.
我怕虫子，但不怕鬼。
To be honest, this town hasn't been that scary.
说真的，这里真没什么吓人的。
I'm having a good time, so I'll hang out here for now.
我在这里玩得挺开心的，\n所以我会多呆一阵子。

Rafael may have a layer of earth protecting him from the surface, but it doesn't protect him from my astral projection.
拉斐尔可能觉得\n在地底可以安然无恙，\n但这并不能保护他不受我的探测。
I've been watching his battles with some fervor. I wish to grasp the essence of his strategy.
我一直在关注着他的战斗，\n希望自己能掌握他的精髓。
It is, at its core, about dancing.
他的对策核心是舞蹈。
His Oricorio and Alolan Marowak both gain power from dancing done by their allies.
他的花舞鸟跟阿罗拉嘎啦嘎啦，\n都能从同伴的舞蹈中汲取力量。
If one was feeling particularly devilish, one could aquire a Hattrem.
如果一个人觉得自己特别邪恶，\n就能得到一个提布莉姆。
That witch has a special ability which can prevent Pokemon from utilizing dance.
而这种宝可梦有一种特殊能力，\n可以阻止宝可梦使用舞蹈。
There's supposed to be a gym leader around here, but he's not keen on taking challengers.
据说这里有一位道馆馆主，\n但他并不喜欢接受挑战。
He lives <imp>underground</imp> like some hermit.
他就跟个隐士似的住在<imp>地下</imp>某处。
Even locked himself up to make it harder to get in.
为了不被外人打扰，\n甚至把自己锁了起来。
Apparently the <imp>lock combination code</imp> is somewhere in the town.
而那把锁的<imp>密码</imp>，\n就在这座废弃城市的某个地方。
This is all a bit too mental for me right now, so I'm taking a break.
但这周围的一切让我有些神经过敏，\n我得休息一会儿了。
A small handmade sign. It lists an eight-digit code in a big, blocky style.
一个手工制作的小牌子，\n其中内嵌了一个八位数的密码锁。
Why are you here?
你为什么在这？
Is this going somewhere?
你来这里干什么？
Who are you?

Why?
为什么？
No way.
不给
Sure.
行吧
Not yet.
还不行
Here you go.
给你。
Why do you want it?
为什么要这个？
[Map9]
STAY AWAY FROM MY PLANTS!
离我的花草远点!
I give up. My plants are doomed to die.
我放弃了，我注定无法保护它们...
To be honest, they're not even my plants. I just wanted to make a nice bouquet for Lainie.
其实这些花草并不是我种的，\n我只是想给兰妮做一个花束。
I just want to protect my plants.
我只是想保护我的植物。
To be honest, they're not even my plants. I don't know who left them here.
其实这些花草并不是我种的，\n我也不知道是谁留在这里的。
I was looking around the sinkhole for the Gym Leader, but he wasn't anywhere around there.
一开始来这里是找馆主的，\n但他貌似不在这附近。
[Map10]
I'm training for my doctorate in Pokemon Biology.
我在攻读宝可梦生物学博士学位。
"Do some field work!", they said. "It'll look great on your CV!', they said.
他们都说，“去实地调研吧！\n这会让你的简历看起来更棒！”
Now here I am, battling the Raikou down there every day to prevent a rampage.
所以我才来到这里，\n为了防止雷公暴走，\n每天都在与它进行对战。
Can't say I'm learning nothing though...
基本什么都没学到...
Phew... Glad that's over. I've had enough battling to last a lifetime.
唉哟...终于结束了。\n我已经把这辈子的对战都打完了。
Time to transfer all my notes to PDF format. Hope the scanners aren't reserved today...
是时候将所有的记录\n转成PDF格式了。\n希望扫描仪今天没有被人预约......
Novo College sends us a daily batch of healing items to keep us going.
望新大学每天都会给\n我们送来一批治疗药物，\n用来维持我们宝可梦的健康。
It's useful, but I don't think my team appreciates getting revived four times a day...
这虽然很有用，\n但我觉得我的队伍\n不喜欢一天被复活四次...
Sheesh, felt the shockwaves all the way back here.
天啊，我甚至在这里\n也感受到了震颤。
Must have been rough. Glad you showed up.
这一定很艰难，但你成功了。
The only thing that's kept Novo safe from this Avatar is us members of the Battle Club.
唯一保护望新免受化身威胁的\n就是我们这些\n对战俱乐部的成员。
The regular folks sure are lucky so many skilled trainers decided to concentrate there...
这里的居民太走运了，\n有那么多实力高超的\n训练家都聚集在那里...
Wowie, now that was a battle!

The club's gonna love to hear about this one.
俱乐部会很高兴听到这个消息。
You should totally come give a talk sometime.
你应该来给我们做个演讲，\n效果肯定很不错。
[Map11]
The berry plant is growing.
树果还在生长中。
Since the Eleig River is in the halfway point of Makya, it's become quite the gathering spot for Trainers.
由于埃利格河位于马凯亚的中心，\n因此成为了训练家们的聚集地。
The trainers on the long stretch of river to the East are relatively casual.
东部河道上的训练家相对随和一些。
That is, until you reach the desert research station.
朝那个方向可以直接到沙漠研究站。
The trainers to the west are a bit more serious, especially as one approaches the Cave of Hatching.
而西边河道的训练家就严肃多了，\n尤其是启明之窟附近。
Hey, yo. Remember me?
嘿，你还记得我吗?
Eifion – guy with the Phione? How you doing?
我是艾维恩，\n带着霏欧纳的那位。\n你最近怎么样? 
Awesome. You doing the gym challenge?
太好了，你是在挑战道馆？
Ah, what am I asking – of course you are.
我在说什么啊...\n这不是肯定的事吗...
Nobody hauls around a killer team like that just for fun. Good luck on that.
没人会为了好玩\n带着这么强力的队伍。\n祝你挑战顺利。
Sure, sure. Don’t mean to pry or anything. Happy to see you’re holding up.
啊，我不是想打听什么。\n只是很高兴看到你过得不错。
Yeah, I get that. I’ve been, uh, yeah, through the wringer, y’know?
啊，大概能理解。\n呃，我也曾经历过...\n类似的状况。
But you just gotta keep your head up.
但你微笑着面对一切，\n挺过难关就好。
Anyways, how about a quick match?
不管怎样，来一场速战速决如何?
Phione here hasn’t been slacking, and I want to show it a proper duel.
霏欧纳可不是吃素的，\n我要好好展现一下它的实力。
You down?
你准备好了吗？
Oh, yeah, take your time. I think I might need a few minutes to get Phione psyched up anyways.
哦，没问题，慢慢来。\n我也得花一些时间\n让霏欧纳准备准备。
Thanks. Don’t go easy on me, OK?
谢谢，请不要手下留情。
Whoa. We actually did it.
哇，我们真的做到了。
Not without some scrapes here and there – wait, let me heal you.
有些磕碰也是在所难免的...\n稍等，让我帮你治疗一下。
Figure I might as well pay you back, huh?
我一直觉得，该报答你一下。
Uh, kinda? I’ve trained worse, but, uh, this little fella isn’t exactly a juggernaut.
呃，还好吧？\n我见过更难对付的宝可梦，\n而且...呃...\n这个小家伙也不是啥凶猛巨兽。
I wouldn’t be quaking in my boots if I had to face one.
我之前对上的要是这小家伙，\n也不会被吓得瑟瑟发抖了。
OK, I think Phione’s good to go. Ready to fight?
好了，我感觉霏欧纳准备好了，\n可以开始战斗了吗？
Good fight, good fight! Phione, you did great.
打得好，打得好！\n霏欧纳，干得漂亮。
I mean, \PN, you obviously did way better, but, hey, that’s how it goes.
虽然\PN，你的表现更好，\n但嘿嘿，事实就是事实。
I used to do a lot better than this. Was pretty good, if I do say so myself, but, eh, it wasn’t really worth it.
要我来说的话，\n我以前那会儿更强呢，\n但是....呃，过去就不提了。
You ever run into someone yelling at his Pokémon after he loses and just think, like, who raised this guy?
你有没有遇到过那种输掉比赛后\n对自己的宝可梦大发雷霆的人？\n你会不会觉得那些家伙...\n很没教养？
Like, yeah, you get results, but it’s not really sustainable.
或许那样能让他们多赢一场，\n但并不利于长久发展。
They have to feel like living, feeling beings first, and tools of battle second.
培育宝可梦就要让它们意识到\n自身存在的重要，\n其次才是把它们当作对战工具。
Or, like, fifth.
呃...感觉还要往后排...
You get what I’m saying, right?
你能明白我什么意思吧？
Figured as much. Look at me talking at you as if you aren’t obviously a better trainer than me.
我觉得也是，\n这么跟你说话，\n搞得好像我比你优秀一样。
I’m OK, but I make a lot of sloppy mistakes. Still trying to learn that whole positive reinforcement thing.
我的水平也就...那样吧，\n经常犯一些粗心大意的错误，\n最近才开始学习心理强化。
You just gotta make them feel loved, and then they’ll try their best.
只要让它们感受到爱，\n它们就会全力以赴。
Pushing them hard wrings potential out of them faster, but it burns them out.
对它们过度施压\n虽然能更快地榨取出潜力，\n但也会让它们身心交瘁。
Eventually they’ll snap back, or just give up. Or leave you.
最终只会反噬到自己，\n要么干脆摆烂，\n要么永远离开你。
Well, sure, but they’re more than tools. They’re alive, and they have their own wants and needs.
好吧，当然，\n但它们不仅仅是工具。\n它们也是生命，\n它们也有自己的欲望和需求。
And if you kinda lean into that, it works so much better than ordering them around.
如果你能稍微顺应这点，\n那比直接命令它们效果好得多。
Or… maybe not. Obviously you know what you’re doing. I’m not gonna preach to you.
或许…也不一定。\n显然你知道自己在干什么，\n我就不对你说教了。
I’ve talked enough. Probably should be listening more, but, uh, I gotta go.
我说得已经够多了，\n也许你并不介意，\n但是...呃，我得走了。
Makya’s a big place, and Phione and I are gonna tour the whole thing.
马凯亚地区面积不小，\n我和霏欧纳要游遍这里的\n每一处角落。
And the rest of us, of course. So, uh, see you. And thanks again.
当然，还有我的其他宝可梦，\n那么，呃，再见，\n再次谢谢你啦。
Li'l bit of havoc going down around here, just like the good ol' days! I'll show ya why we used to be the top dogs!
最近这里有一些小骚动，\n就像我所怀念的以前一样！\n我会向你展示\n我们曾是顶尖训练家的原因！
Beaten by another freakishly-talented kid? Deja vu, that's what that is...
又被另一个天赋异禀的小鬼打败了？\n怎么总是这样…
Ah, you ain't nothing. I could beat you any day of the week. Just not... today.
啊，你什么都不是。\n我哪天都能赢你。\n只不过不是…今天。
I totally lost my surfboard!
我的冲浪板丢了！
At least I can swim.
好在我会游泳。
Prizca Bridge
宏礼大桥
Prizca Sewers Auxiliary Entrance
宏礼下水道辅助出口
A line which might have read "Authorized Personnel Only" has been crisscrossed with crude graffiti.
下面大概写着“仅限工作人员”，\n但被粗暴地划掉了。
I was thinking of bringing my toddlers to see the bridge. Guess that plan is ruined.
我本来想带孩子们来大桥这边玩的，\n现在看来计划泡汤了。
Field trip's cancelled!
活动取消！
I'll look on my phone for anything interesting nearby.
我该去网上查查，\n周围有什么其他有趣的地方。
Maybe I schedule a trip to the Gym?
或许...道馆一日游？

Why'd they send a waitress to keep watch when an avatar's on the prowl? This is why!
为什么在化身四处游荡时\n派一名女服务员来看守？\n这就是原因！
So, uh, when I said "this is why!" I was supposed to then beat you, and that, uh, didn't happen. So... I'm just gonna go now.
所以，嗯，\n当我说“这就是原因！”的时候，\n本该揍你一顿，但是...\n好吧...我现在得走了。
Well, uh... I guess you're gonna have to cover my shift, 'cause I gotta go hit the Pokécenter.
呃，嗯…你得替我值班了，\n因为我要去宝可梦中心。
Now that the bridge is gone, I can swim in peace. Or I could if it wasn't for kids like you!
现在桥没了，\n如果不是因为你这样的小孩，\n我早就能安心游泳了！
Wow, you're just as annoying as the cars. I'm out.
哇，你跟那些车一样讨厌，\n我得走了。
Cool surfing kid, but don't put me in the splash zone next time.
小子，冲浪很酷，\n但下次别溅我一身水。
No one else comes here, so I guess we're just a little strange.
居然没有人来这里，\n这也太奇怪了。
Great.
很好
Fine.
还行
Could be better.
不太好
Let me prep.
稍等一会儿
Sure, let's go.
好，来吧
Aren't Phione strong?
霏欧纳很强吗？
Of course.
没错
I guess?
大概吧
They make good tools.
工具，好用

A locked door. It has a slot for a keycard.
一扇带有钥匙卡插槽的门，\n并且锁得很牢。
You insert the Team Chasm ID Card.
你插入了裂隙队身份卡。
The door unlocks with a click.
门咔嗒一声开了。
Hey, Trainer. You seem like the classy type.
嘿，训练家，\n你的气质很非比寻常嘛。
Let me guess. Born rich? Toxic family relationships? Rampant imposter syndrome coupled with a crippling need to define yourself?
让我猜猜...出身豪门？\n家庭关系不合？\n强烈渴望成功的灵魂？\n对自我价值实现的强烈需求？
Well, you look like the perfect fit for this Skitty I've managed to get.
你看起来很适合\n我搞到的这只向尾喵。
For the absolute steal of $200,000, I'll let you get your hands on one. And guess what -- it's shiny.
只需要$200,000，\n它就是你的了，\n而且你猜怎么着 - 它是异色的！
Show that to your... mom? Dad? No, definitely mom. Probably a sibling in there as well, huh?
拿给你的…妈妈或爸爸看？\n不，绝对是妈妈，\n估计还有一个兄弟姐妹吧？
I'm sure you'll get at least a week's worth of self- worth flaunting that to them. All that quality time for just $200,000.
拿这个跟他们炫耀后，\n至少能获得一星期的昂首挺胸权。\n只要$200,000哦，心动不如行动！
Hah! That's what they all say. You'll be back, sooner or later.
哈！大家都是这么说的，\n但早晚会回来。
The Pokemon is all yours, enjoy it while you can.
这宝可梦是你的了，\n尽情享受被尊重的感觉吧。
And with that, my early retirement has been secured.
有了这笔钱，\n我就可以提前退休了。
Tata suck- uhh, client.
再见了，冤大...\n咳，客人。
With that trifling sum? Surely you can do better than that.
只不过是一笔小钱而已嘛？\n你得到的可远超这个价值。
Ah, so you've finally caved? $200,000 for the shiny Skitty. No more, no less.
啊，终于想通了？\n$200,000买这只异色向尾喵。
Are you going into the sauna?
你要去蒸桑拿吗?
Careful to not go into the underground area. It's where we keep the wild Pokemon that heat up the place.
请不要进入地下区域，\n那里关着我们用来发热的\n野生宝可梦。
Unless you want to catch said wild Pokemon I guess...
除非你想抓几只…
Well, if you get hurt down there, that's on you.
但是受伤了概不负责！
The sauna is only available to the Rangers and their families.
桑拿房只对义军和其家人开放。
You'll need a ID Card to get in there.
没有身份卡不能进。
I'm good.
我不需要
Sure, I'll pay for that.
好，我买了
[Map14]
[Map15]
I got some extra dynamite. Want it for $5000?
我这里有多余的炸药，\n$5000卖你？
Eh, I can't blame ya. It's dangerous stuff.
好吧，毕竟这玩意很危险。
Hey, I'll be glad to be done with it.
乐意至极。
You hand over $5000 in exchange.
将$5000交给对方。
Well, the clock waits for no one. Work calls!
好嘞，时间不等人，工作在召唤！
You playing at something?
那你还来商店干嘛？
No
不要
Yes
买
[Map16]
Walking through Makya really makes me appreciate the drive of some folk.
在逛完马凯亚之后，\n我是真的欣赏某些人的决心。
They basically looked at a spot, decided they wanted to build an entire tech campus over it, and they did it.
他们一次次地在荒芜之地，\n凭空建立起一座座城镇，\n甚至还有这个科技园区。
Wild stuff.
太疯狂了。
[Map17]
A home review show is playing on the television.
电视上正在播放家庭节目。
The host is obviously enthused, but the sound is muted, so it's hard to tell what specifically she's excited about.
主持人的表情显得很兴奋，\n但电视的声音太小了，\n你根本听不清她在说什么。
A dim light shines from the computer.
电脑指示灯亮着。
Hey y'all! We've got a super special report on the latest in Pokemon!
大家好，我们将在此，\n为大家报道最新的宝可梦新闻！
Today we're doing a report on Traits!
今天，是关于“性情”的报道！
What do they mean? What do they do? Which ones are the best?
性情是什么？有什么用？\n哪些性情的宝可梦相对更好呢？
Well...
嗯...
Traits are little parts of a Pokemon's personality that you might discover after spending some time with them.
每只宝可梦除了外在的性格外，\n还有更为内敛的性情区分，\n因此刚刚被捕捉的宝可梦，\n是不会立即表露它们的性情的，
Pokemon don't always show their hand as soon as you catch them, you need to bond with them to learn more about them!
训练家们需要与它们建立起\n更紧密的感情纽带，\n才能一点点深入地了解它们！
They don't do anything in battle! Any Pokemon can learn to battle just the same!
性情在对战中并没有什么作用，
When it comes to battling, no personality is better than the other!
所有性情的宝可梦都可以\n学习各种各样的战斗技巧！
All that matters is finding the right Pokemon for you!
最重要的，\n是找到与你性情相合的那一只哦！
That's all for today, ciao!
今天就到这里，再见！
Well, this will probably be my last entry here.
这可能是我最后一篇日志了。
Mine's been closed.
矿场已经关闭了。
Permanently, this time. Can't say why.
这一次将是永久关闭，\n至于原因，我不能说。
Team Chasm has been sending people in and out of the mine every few hours for the last three days.
过去三天里，\n裂隙队每隔几小时\n就会派人进入矿区。
It sucks that they're doing this, but they've offered jobs to everyone in the crew.
他们这种做法真的很讨厌，\n可这份工作又是他们给的。
I wouldn't be allowed to turn down that offer, even if I wanted to.
即便我想拒绝他们，\n也不能这样做。
Guess I'll have to relocate. Sounds like they'll be putting me somewhere in Southwest Makya.
我估计要搬家了，\n听说他们会把我安置在\n马凯亚西南方的某个地方。
Gonna miss little Braden. He's a good kid.
我会想念小布雷登的，\n他是个好孩子。
Oh, hello there.
哦，你好。
No doubt you can hear my child upstairs, shouting and running around dressed up in that stupid Pikachu costume.
你肯定已经听到了吧，\n我儿子正穿着傻里傻气的皮卡丘服，\n在楼上大喊大叫，跑来跑去。
He never shuts up about becoming a Pokemon master. Those cartoons must have rotted his brain.
他已经被那些动画片洗脑了，\n总是嚷着要称为宝可梦大师。
He needs a reality check. He should find better career paths, like a doctor or lawyer.
该让他清醒清醒了，\n当个医生或者律师不更好吗？
You look like a competent trainer.
你看起来很厉害。
If you utterly destroy whatever stupid 'team' he's assembled, I'll give you a reward.
如果你能彻底击败他，\n我会给你一个奖励。
Have him make a fool of himself, that might set him straight.
让他出进洋相，\n才有可能改邪归正。
I can still hear his incessant screaming. Please, just stop the kid already.
你听，现在他还在楼下不停地叫，\n求你了，让这熊孩子安静下来吧！
I'm sure crushing him in a battle will be enough to make him stop.
只要你能在战斗中彻底击败他，\n他才能明白什么是现实。
Thank you. Now that his childish dream is done, we can finally get him to sit down and learn something useful.
谢谢你纠正了他那幼稚的想法，\n这样他就能安静地坐下来\n学习一些有用的东西了。
Here, take this as payment. I'd offer money to anyone else, but Trainers like these sort of things.
给，这个是你的了。\n本来想给你些钱的，\n不过训练家应该更喜欢这个。
One day, that kid will enroll in a college and get a degree that makes some good money.
等那孩子长大，进入大学，\n拿到一个能赚大钱的学位后，
I'll be proud of him then.
我会为他感到骄傲的。
Traits: Pokemon and You!
性情：宝可梦与人类

I've always dreamed of being a Pokemon Trainer! Yesterday I went out and caught some. Now my mom HAS to let me be a trainer!
我一直都想成为一名训练家！\n昨天我出去抓了一些宝可梦，\n现在我妈妈肯定会同意了！
You understand right? If I do well in my first battle, my mom will see what I'm capable of!
你明白我的意思吧？\n只要我的第一场战斗\n能够表现出足够的潜力，\n妈妈就不会再阻止我！
Battle?
来战吧！
You just don't get it.
你根本不懂！
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
让我们开 ---- 始吧！
I'm down but not out. You can't ever put me down.
虽然输了，但我不会气馁，\n我永远都不会放弃！

Get lost kid.
小孩别挡道
Sure.
来吧

I live for trash TV.
我超爱看肥皂剧的。
Last week Kimberly slapped Evan because she caught him reading a romance novel that featured a cycling couple.
上周埃文在读一本自行车情侣的\n言情小说时被金柏莉发现了，\n然后就挨了一个响亮的耳光。
They got into a huge fight and ended up breaking all the furniture.
然后他们就大打出手，\n几乎干碎了所有家具。
Here's the catch -- they aren't even dating. They knew each other for four days.
但是...他们还没有约过会，\n甚至才认识了四天。
She was jealous because she thought Evan was hinting that she needed to work out more.
金柏莉生气的原因是\n她觉得埃文在讽刺她缺乏锻炼。
How dramatic!
什么狗血剧情！
Anyways, thanks for letting me share my passion for a bit.
总之，感谢你听我说这么多。
Here's how I enjoy these shows to the max, you should try it too.
这就是我充分享受\n这些电视剧的方式，\n你也可以试试。
Trash TV really is the best. Can't wait for the next episode.
肥皂剧真是太好看啦，\n下一集什么时候播啊！
Be wary of Abilities that grant a Pokemon an immunity they might otherwise not have.
要警惕那些赋予宝可梦\n免疫能力的特性。
You might think that a Ground-type attack will knock out your opponant's Eelektross, only to find out that it has Levitate!
不要以为地面系的攻击\n可以解决对手的麻麻鳗鱼王，\n因为它们有漂浮特性！
Abilities that grant resistances, such as Realist and Tough, should also be respected.
像现实主义和坚不可摧这种，\n可以赋予宝可梦抗性的特性，\n都应当重视起来。
If your Pokemon attacks the same target with the same attack, the damage will always be the same!
如果你的宝可梦以相同的招式，\n攻击同一个目标，\n那么伤害将始终一样！
That means that if you're able to crunch the numbers, you can figure out how many attacks it'll take to knock out an opposing Pokemon!
所以你可以计算出需要多少招，\n才能击败对方的宝可梦!
Critical hits are the exception to this, of course.
如果击中要害了另说。
The TV shows a Dragon-tamer breaking up with a Lady in what seems like a staged moment.
电视上正在播出一位驯龙师\n和一位女士闹分手的剧情。
It seems like Ribombee is helping organize the books!
蝶结萌虻正在帮忙整理书籍！
Hey, you want a cup of coffee?
你好，要来杯咖啡吗？
It's gonna cost you $250.
一共$250。
Sounds good. Come back when you want a cup.
什么时候想喝了再来吧。
Thank you for your patronage.
谢谢惠顾。
Wow, you are broke. Go get some cash.
你破产了吗？这里需要现金支付。
Oh hello dearie, you wouldn't happen to be a Trainer would you?
哦，你好，\n你不会碰巧是训练家吧？
My husband and I have decided to get another Fairy- type friend for our Ribombees and Cutieflies.
我和我的丈夫决定为\n我们店里的萌虻们，\n找一只新的妖精系伙伴。
We managed to go and catch a Milcery, but it's a little too shy for how busy we are.
我们抓了一只小仙奶，\n但因为没时间照顾它，\n导致相处得不算很亲密。
If you have another Fairy-type, I think it'd be nice to have a little trade.
如果你有另一只妖精系宝可梦，\n那我觉得来一次小小交换也很不错\n（在箱子里选择宝可梦）。
Oh, alright. You tell me if you change your mind now.
哦，好吧。\n如果你改变主意了再告诉我。
Come back if you can find a Fairy-type!
你找到妖精系宝可梦后再来吧!
Oh this little one is perfect, I'm sure our regulars will love it.
哦，这小家伙简直完美，\n我相信我们的常客会喜欢它的。
Thank you dear, people will be excited to meet the new face here.
谢谢你，\n大家肯定会喜欢这个新面孔的。
Things are going well dear, your Pokemon has been quite the hit with our customers.
 一切都很顺利，\n你的宝可梦很受我们顾客的欢迎。
Take care of the old mascot dear, I'm sure it hates being cooped up in a place like this.
另外还请你照顾好那只小仙奶，\n或许它只是不喜欢被关在这里吧。
A book called "Gangs of Castelia" lays on the table.
桌上放着一本名叫\n《卡斯蒂利亚黑帮》的书。
A sticker on the front states that it was adapted into a major motion picture.
根据封标显示，\n这本书曾被改编成电视剧。
Me and my Obstagoon love to come here to read.
我和我的堵拦熊喜欢来这里读书。
Many people are surprised that an Obstagoon would like reading.
很多人对此感到吃惊。
I tell them not to judge a book by its cover!
我总是教训他们不要以貌取熊！
Ribombee seems to really be enjoying the TV show.
蝶结萌虻好像真的很喜欢\n这个电视节目。
I hate reading. I don't even know why I come here.
我讨厌读书...\n我都不知道为什么会来这里。
The coffee isn't even that great...
咖啡也不怎么好喝…
It's a TV guide.
电视节目表。
You're surprised they still make these.
什么年代了还有这玩意！
I have a younger brother who is very, very dense.
我弟弟真是太太太太奇怪了。
He's obsessed with water and the ocean. And especially with making metaphors about them.
他脑子里全是水啊，\n海啊之类的东西，\n并且总喜欢拿这些做比喻。
He constantly talks about super weird stuff like "darkness" and "crushing pressure".
还老是讲一些很怪的东西，\n比如“黑暗”“压强”什么的。
I'm not gonna rain on his his parade. It's just really weird that --
我不想泼他冷水，\n但这也太古怪了，毕竟...
...
...
Did I just use a water metaphor? Ugh, maybe it's rubbing off on me...
我刚刚是不是也用了水的比喻？\n我也要变奇怪了吗...
Hundreds of comic books, magazines, and graphic novels line the shelves.
书架上摆放着数以百计的\n漫画书、杂质和小说。
Many Trainers starting their Gym Challenge know that Burn can reduce an enemy Pokemon's Attack.
很多训练家都知道。\n灼伤可以降低对手的攻击。
But some Trainers still don't know that Frostbite reduces an enemy's Special Attack.
但是有些训练家还不知道，\n冻伤会降低对手的特攻。
On top of this, Numb reduces all of a Pokemon's damage while being coupled with a Speed reduction.
此外，还有麻痹这个状态，\n不只是减少宝可梦的速度，\n还能降低它所造成的所有伤害。
While it might be appealing to utilize Numb's flexibility, the specialized effects of Frostbite and Burn are stronger than that of Numb's.
虽说麻痹的效果听起来厉害，\n但冻伤和灼伤的针对性更好。
The adults don't let me swim in the pond, so I like to run down to the Eleig River.
大人们不让我在池塘里游泳，\n所以我就常去埃利格河。
But my shortcut there, the Gigalith's Guts, has a bunch of Avatars now.
但是现在怪岩肠道里有很多的化身，\n这条捷径已经没法走了。
It stinks!
好烦！
The atmosphere here is nice.

Hey, interested in the Novo Battling Club?
嘿，对望新对战俱乐部有兴趣吗？
If you haven't met him already, you can speak with Louis to participate in the battles.
如果你有兴趣的话，\n可以去找路易斯谈谈。
Otherwise, take this, courtesy of the Café.
无论你的答复为何，\n都请收下咖啡厅的心意。
Use that cookie to heal your Pokemon of any status condition -- even those that are Dizzy or Leeched!
使用这块饼干可以恢复\n你宝可梦的异常状态 - \n其中包括混乱和寄生！
Dizzy and Leech both have their uses, though some cases are better than others!
混乱和寄生都有各自的用处，\n在某些情况下起到逆转战局的效果！
Dizzy Pokemon have their abilities surpressed and take extra damage!
混乱状态下宝可梦会失去其特性，\n还将受到更高的伤害！
Leeched Pokemon have their health stolen by their opponent! In a double battle, the healing is split between both opponents.
而处于寄生状态的宝可梦\n将会被吸走自己的HP！\n如果是双打对战，\n这部分HP会平均分给两个对手。
It seems like the Riolu is trying to reach for a book, but it's too short to grab it on its own.
利欧路好像想拿一本书，\n但以它的身高根本够不到。
Do you want to help the Pokemon?
要帮利欧路吗？
Maybe it'll figure a way out on its own.
得让它学会自己想办法。
You grab a copy of "The Adventures of Mighty Morpeko 6: Golduck's Great Revenge".
你顺着它的目光拿了一本\n《强悍莫鲁贝可历险记6：\n哥达鸭的大复仇》。
The Riolu gives a polite bow while you hand it the book.
当你把书递给它时，\n利欧路礼貌地鞠了一躬。
Riolu is really enjoying its comic book!
利欧路真的很喜欢这本漫画。
No

I can sense the life force of all living things.

你的技术足以打败我，\n我对你深表敬意。
But nothing happened...
但是什么都没发生...
I am camped out here.
我是在这里扎营的。
There is no reason to be suspicious.
你不用怀疑我。
I had forgotten, but my camping spot is actually elsewhere.
哦，忘了，\n我的露营点不在这里。
Please do not follow me.
不要跟着我。
Roasting smores. That is an aspect of camping that I enjoy.
露营最吸引我的地方，\n就在于营火！
I love flowers. Do you love flowers?
我很喜欢花，你喜欢吗？
I must go. The reason certainly involves aromas, for that is what category of person I am.
我必须得走了，\n原因当然是跟花香有关，\n因为我就是这样的人。
Smelling flowers. Their aroma. It is simply the best.
闻着花香，感受这种每秒。
The hike out here was quite nice. A battle will be a good way to end my trip. Let us begin now.
来这里徒步旅行可太爽了，\n正好用一场战斗做个完美的收尾吧。
I assure you that my interest in hiking is very normal.
对远足感兴趣是件很正常的事。
To prove it, I will now hike away from here.
为了证明这一点，\n我现在就徒步离开这里。
Battling is very similar to rock climbing, in that I partake in both.

Dialogue here.
说啥？
Trimmed metallic vines hang from the wall. There's not enough material to make anything further.
修剪过的金属藤蔓挂载墙上，\n没有足够的材料制作更多东西。
Stop! The law states clearly that this is an illegal action!
停下你的违法行为，\n这里暂时不允许通行！
A ranger station is above us, in Grouz. I know that because I saw it myself.
我们头顶上就是古治站，\n因为我亲眼看到了。
I will go there to report your illegal activities.
我会去举报你的。
As an agent of the law, I am dissapointed that I was not able to overpower you.
很遗憾，作为执法者，\n我却没办法制服你。
There was an entire cave of iron plants and no one mentioned it to me?
这么大一个铁树洞，\n就没人跟我讲过？
Isn't that a little suspicious?
是不是很可疑？
But who among us knows the truth about what happened here?
但是，谁知道这里的真相呢？
This whole place shouldn't exist. I can't find words to describe how I'm feeling.
这个地方感觉都不该存在，\n我无法用语言来形容这种感受。
It's like, a feeling of dread. That something is about to happen.
这就像是一种恐惧感，\n有什么事情要发生一般。
That a few words could cause something to wake up.

Maybe you'll be able to find it. Good luck.
或许你也能遇到，\n祝你好运。
Collecting a loss like that wasn't on my agenda.
我没有把这种小损失放在心上。
[Map21]
One moment – there we go. I’m going to take notes this time.
稍等...好了，\n这次我会做笔记的。
I’ll admit it: I’m curious. What do you bring to the table that no other challenger does?
我承认，我很好奇。\n你身上有哪些\n其他挑战者所没有的点？
No matter what praise Tamarind or the others heap upon you, don’t let it go to your head.
无论塔玛琳或者其他人\n对你的评价有多高，\n也不要被赞誉冲昏头脑。
I’m rather more rigorous in my analyses.
我会更严谨地分析你的能力。
Let’s begin.
现在开始吧。
All of that work to get here and now you test my patience?
事已至此，你却来考验我的耐心？
Ugh. Go. I can work while you’re gone.
呃...行吧，我要继续做工作了。
I reared Team Chasm from its infancy.
我把裂隙队从襁褓中养大。
I turned this place from wilderness to a modern region.
在这个地区的荒郊野岭里，\n建立了一座座城镇。
I am the beating heart of Makya.
我就是马凯亚跳动的心脏。
Fine! One of us needs to be humbled. Show me which one of us it is.
看来今天我们之间，\n得有个人被搓搓锐气了，\n你觉得会是谁呢？
Don’t expect this to be easy simply because I work from behind the scenes.
别以为我在幕后工作就好对付了。
I made this region what it is today.
是我让这个地区变成了今天的样子。
Show me what you can do – or are you just what you’ve inherited from Mavis? Show me!
你到底是有真材实料，\n还是仅靠梅维斯的名声\n被吹捧出来的？\n就让我好好见识一下吧！
No! I can’t – how? Eight years and I still can’t beat an arrogant child!
不！不可能！怎么会...\n八年了，\n我竟然还是打不过一个狂妄的小鬼！
No, no, you and your Pokémon deserve the Patience Badge.
算了，算了，\n你和你的宝可梦配得上耐心徽章。
No, no, you and your Pokémon deserve that victory.
算了，算了，\n你和你的宝可梦配得上这场胜利。
Just do me a favor and beat Tamarind just as badly someday. You’re not the only one with a childish rivalry.
另外，答应我一件事，\n回头找个时间，像今天打败我一样，\n狠狠地教训一顿塔玛琳，\n不是只有你才有所谓的劲敌。
Although – and you may know where I’m going with this – there is one other thing...
另外...\n你可能已经知道我要说什么了，\n没错，还有一件事...
My decision to not employ gym trainers is paying dividends.
看来不雇佣道馆训练家，\n的确有很多好处。
Now there’s no one to watch me keep losing.
起码没人会看到我输。

I’ll make the time, whenever you want to give me yours. Good day, \PN.
只要你想，我随时能抽出时间，\n祝你好运，\PN。
A screensaver image of a Luxray bounces lazily around the screen.
伦琴猫的屏保在\n屏幕上跳来跳去。
Yo, champ in the making!
你好，未来的冠军！
Helena runs a tight ship around here.
海伦娜对这里的管理非常严格。
Even I can't get away with just standing around all day!
就算是我也不能整天站着做招待！
Helena understands that efficiency comes from information, and information from the flow of communication.
她的理念是“效率来源于情报，\n情报来源于沟通与流动。”
That's why she's focused her gym around Electric-type and Water-type Pokemon!
因此，作为她的道馆，\n这里专精的也是电系和水系宝可梦！
They're a strong pair in battles, sharing no weaknesses.
这是两种配合起来很强力的属性，\n它们没有共同的弱点。
Firstly, Grass-type Pokemon are your best bet against her, since they're strong against Water- types, and resist Electric.
草属性宝可梦一定是最优选，\n既能克制水系，也能抵抗电系。
Secondarily, Dragon-type Pokemon will resist both Water and Electric.
再就是龙属性，\n可以同时抵抗水系和电系攻击。
Finally, mirroring her with Electric-type Pokemon of your own can work well too.
再有，如果你也使用电系，\n或许也能很好地反制她。
They're strong against Water-types, and resist Electric.
在某些情况下，\n电系也能起到与草系差不多的作用。
Hope that helps!
希望这些对你有用！
You out-maneuvered Team Chasm's best strategist!
你靠着策略击败了\n裂隙队最强的战术家！
Congratulations, I hope you feel good about that one!
恭喜啊，\n希望你能好好享受此刻的心情！
We were initially hesitant to partake in constructing gyms, but we chose to do so for two reasons.
我们一开始对\n是否建造这座道馆有些犹豫，\n但考虑到两点还是这样做了。
Firstly, it provided legitimacy.
第一，是为了合法性。
Secondly, it allowed us to find exceptional trainers such as yourself.
第二，是为了能够遇到一些，\n像你这样优秀的训练家。
I would like you to take this key, with the understanding that through the door it unlocks is a particularly dangerous avatar.
我希望你能拿上这把钥匙，\n同时你也要清楚地意识到，\n门后面是一个格外危险的化身。
Obliterate it. Show me that our search is over.
只要将它消灭掉，\n这里的危机就解除了。
You'll find the problem at the north wall of Team Chasm HQ. Well, former HQ.
你可以在裂隙队前总部的北墙上\n找到一扇那种特殊的门，\n记住，是前总部。
The avatar still exists. I’m patient, but I would be lying if I said I didn’t yearn for the day it was gone.
这个化身不会脱困的，\n虽然我有耐心，但也想尽快消灭它。
It is my most-despised responsibility.
我很讨厌这种责任。
Search the north wall of Team Chasm HQ.
记得去查看裂隙队前总部的北墙。
It’s gone?
把它消灭了？
I never thought I’d share Andris’s joy in seeing a problem -- how would he put it? -- deep-sixed, but this does feel good.
没想到我会跟安德里斯一样，\n在问题解决时感到这么兴奋...\n用他的话怎么说来着？\n啊，终于搞定了，舒畅！
Thank you. That’s a weight off of my shoulders, not to mention proof my idea worked.
谢谢你让我卸掉了身上的负担，\n同时证明了我想法的可行性。
Good day, \PN.
祝你好运，\PN。
And thank you.
谢谢。
Oh... good. You.
哦！哦...是你。
I’m going to be honest: I’m not really a fan.
实话实说，我并不是很想看到你。
Oh, don’t take it personally. I don’t like anyone around here.
别想太多，\n我只是讨厌这里的一切罢了。
As soon as I’ve got my fortune, I’m leaving this damned region behind.
等我攒了足够的钱，\n就会离开这个该死的地方。
I’m going to live on a megayacht in the warm Alolan waters, writing semi-autobiographical erotica under a penname.
我打算隐居在温暖的阿罗拉，\n在附近买一艘游艇做住所，\n取个笔名写写半自传体的小黄书。
And I never have to think about any of you ever again.
这样我就不用想起包括你在内的，\n这里的所有人了。
Well, maybe I’ll invite Tamarind. Just to rub it in her face, of course. Of course...
呃...或许我会写塔玛琳？\n当然，她必然是丑角，必然...
Not yet.
稍等
Let's.
来吧

Dialogue here.
在此停下。
You'll need at least two Pokémon or a partner if you want to battle me.
如果你想要跟我对战，\n至少需要两只宝可梦。
You think you can make it past my team? I hope you prepared!
你觉得能打赢我了？\n希望你真的做好准备了！
Time for me to move on. Look out for any other pro trainers like me!
我现在要走了，\n请关注我们这些职业训练家哦！
Decorate time

Your Pokemon are now healed.
你的宝可梦已经痊愈。

Presenting, my very own Normal-type attack!
介绍一下，\n这是我的独创的一般系招式！
Is it Physical, you ask? Special, perhaps? It's both, of course!
物理还是特殊？\n那当然两者都有！
Your Pokemon uses whichever is best for their stats!
适应之力听说过吗？\n这招会根据宝可梦的能力值\n以更高伤害的形态出击！
Is there a catch, hmmm? ...Yes...the move misses 30 percent of the time.
有没有什么副作用？\n嗯…有，失手的几率略高一点。
Whaddya say? Nearly every Normal-type Pokemon can be taught this move, and even a few others.
你觉得怎么样？\n几乎每只一般系的宝可梦\n都可以学会这个招式，\n某些别的宝可梦也能学。
Truly you've struck the motherload of moves!
你可是学到了一项前所未有的神技！
Fine... I just wanted something to do now that the mine's closed...
好吧…现在矿场关了，\n我只是想找点事情做罢了。
What're you doing?!
你在干什么？
You're \PN, right? The trainer the Professor called in?
你是\PN，对吧？\n博士叫来的训练家？
So go destroy that Avatar before we're all killed!
那就在大家被杀死前，\n干掉那个化身吧！
I used to use a lot of Life Orbs. Didn't care if my Pokemon got hurt so long as they did the work.
我以前只在乎能否完成任务，\n不在意宝可梦们是否会受伤，\n所以经常使用生命宝珠。
But I'm not that kind of person any more. I'm looking to rid myself of them.
但我现在变了，\n我不想再那样做了。
I've just got one left. I'll sell it to you for $10,000. Fair market value.
$10,000把生命宝珠卖你怎样，\n其他地方通常也是这个价格。
Sounds good. I'll be on patrol for awhile now, so hit me up if you change your mind.
好的，如果你改变主意了，\n可以再联系我。\n我现在要进行巡逻了。
Here ya go, pleasure doing business.
很高兴能与你达成这笔交易。
\PN hands over $10000 in exchange.
\PN 将$10000 交给对方。
Guess I'll go back on patrol now.
我要回去巡逻了。
Looks like you're a bit short on cash.
看来你手头有点紧啊。
I get that, wasn't in the best financial spot myself before I joined Chasm.
我能理解，\n在加入裂隙队之前我也没啥钱。
Despite their pain, my team still loves battling.
曾经我的宝可梦们\n都生活地很痛苦，\n但它们依然在奋力战斗着。
To be honest, I don't deserve their forgiveness. I hurt them, but they still forgave me.
说实话，我不值得它们宽恕，\n我伤害了它们，\n但它们还是选择原谅我。
I get a bit emotional everytime I think about it, haha.
每次想起这些都有点感慨，哈哈。

My my, I hope you aren't here to battle. I won't be able to tell my Pokemon anything if you keep taking my breath away.
你不会是来找我战斗的吧！\n连个喘气的时间都不给，\n我还怎么跟宝可梦们培养感情。
Oh, you are? Ah, I suppose a rose as pretty as you would have some very sharp thorns...
你的确是为了战斗而来吗？\n好吧，但要小心哦，\n漂亮的玫瑰都有着锐利的尖刺...
I laid out each of these starter tokens to maybe attact someone suitable... for battle.
我在这里留下了三枚代币，\n来作为对战的奖励。
Perhaps you'll be able to satisfy both criteria...
就看你能不能达成我的条件了...
The top of the sign is labeled "Grouz Mine Bulletin."
最上面一层是“古治矿场公告。”
Remnants of old, yellowed papers are still stapled to the rest.
边边角角处还能看到\n一些老旧发黄的残留碎纸片。
What a disgrace.
真丢人。
We're supposed to be keeping this area safe.
我们应该保护这里的安全的。
The thing's not even fully evolved!
它们甚至还没有完全进化！
A call for you, Trainer.
你的电话，训练家。
The ranger hands you a cell phone.
义军成员将手机递给你。
Heard a certain metal worm is no longer with us. You won’t see me at the funeral.
听说某条金属虫子已经被解决了？\n它的葬礼我就不出席了。
Anyways, I’m a woman of my word – I’ll be your friend in high places.
总之，我是个言而有信的人，\n我会以我的身份给你些帮助。
I’m holed up in <imp>Helena’s place</imp>, west of the LuxTech eyesore.
我现在在<imp>海伦娜的地盘</imp>，\n从碍眼的光华市往西走。
North-west of the lake, can’t miss it.
这里的东南方向有个湖，\n应该挺好找的。
Oh, and bring your team. I invited another guest.
对了，带上你的宝可梦队伍，\n我还邀请了另外一个客人。
Ah, where were you in the good ol’ days? You would’ve made a great grunt!
啊，为什么那时候你不在这里。\n你一定是一个优秀的士兵！
...That’s a compliment, by the way. See ya there.
...听不懂无所谓，\n总之是句夸奖，到时再见。
You gotta keep sharp! Don’t tell me you’re sick of fights.
保持敏锐和警惕，\n别告诉我你已经厌倦对战了。
Our guest’s pretty good, too. She might teach you a thing or two.
这个客人可是不可多得的，\n或许她还能教你两招。
Well, see ya.
到时再见。
You think I’M bad? Try working with Helena for a few years. Especially back when she had strike teams at her disposal.
你觉得我很难相处？\n试着跟海伦娜公事几年吧，\n尤其是她手下有军队的时候。
You’re strong. You’ve proven that. This’ll be a piece of cake. Trust me. So I’ll see ya there.
你已经证明了自己的实力，\n我觉得这场战斗对你来说\n不过小菜一碟，到时候见。
…She hung up.
…她挂断了。
Thanks for the help.
谢谢。
Dr. Hekata's House

The door is boarded up.
这扇门被木板封死了。
Hello, \PN. It’s been quite some time!
你好，\PN，\n好久不见!
Though I’ve heard tales of someone that looked like you talking to someone that looked like me by a certain river that I know a certain Ditto appreciates.
我听说有人看到两个\n长得很像我们的人，\n在那只百变怪经常出没的河边聊天。
Well, I say that, but I suppose I’ve never verified that she is, in fact, a Ditto.
嗯，说归说，\n但我还没确定她到底\n是不是百变怪。
I have never seen her un-transformed, specifically.
我并没见过她的原形。
I have tried tossing a Poké Ball at her, with no effect other than a withering glower.
之前朝她扔精灵球，\n除了得到了一个鄙视的眼神外，\n没有任何效果。
She could be anything, I suppose, but what else can take human form for so long with such accuracy?
理论上讲她可以是任何生物，\n但除了百变怪外，\n还有什么能像她这样\n维持这么久的人形态？
A particularly persistent and vocal Zoroark? Perhaps some other Pokémon that learns Transform?
一只能长时间维持变身\n且会说人话的索罗亚克？\n还是其他会变身招式的宝可梦？
Or perhaps she really is simply a doppelganger of eldritch origin, or a spirit haunting me for some forgotten transgression.
还是说她真的是\n来自另一个世界的我？\n又或是某个因为我的过错\n而一直纠缠不休的鬼魂？
The one that gave you that amulet – not that it matters.
因为我给了你那个护身符...\n算了这不重要。
Don’t worry, I don’t take any offense! My doppelganger and I are more alike than we are different.
放心，我不会因为这而生气，\n毕竟大家分不清也实属正常。
How, precisely, would a Ditto learn to imitate my manners with such care...?
不过...百变怪又是\n怎么模仿我的行为举止的呢？
I suppose it bears little tangible relevance to my situation, though.
讨论这些对我现在的处境\n并没有实质性的意义。
Oh, I’m sorry I’m such a glum philosopher archetype.
抱歉，我是不是表现得太沉闷了？
If I must play a stock role in your story, I would prefer to be an oracle distributing wisdom, or a magical creature bestowing some blessing or artifact.
如果我真的要在\n你的故事中扮演一名角色，\n我更愿意做散播智慧的先知，\n或是赐予祝福的精灵。
I hope you’re not expecting any wisdom or artifacts from me.
当然，希望你不要指望我\n真能提供什么智慧或祝福。
I fear I’m far too invested in my own quest for self- discovery to aid you in yours.
我怕自己过于投入在\n自己的探求中而忽略了对你的帮助。
...Oh, that isn’t true. I can’t maintain a charade of indifference half as well as my companion. I am rather invested in you and yours.
不过实际上，这种可能不大，\n我对你的事情很感兴趣，\n没办法像她那样故作冷漠。
Thank you.
谢谢。
I could easily take the simple explanation afforded to all diviners: that I am interested in you because I have foretold some matter of interest in your future.
我只能简单地告诉你：\n我预见了一些你未来会遇到的事。
Unfortunately, I am insufferably honest, so I must confess that I simply enjoy your company.
可惜，我实在不擅长撒谎，\n其实我只是喜欢与你一起的时光。
Indeed. You are plainly at the center of a whorl of causality here – it takes no arcana to determine that.
你现身处于因果漩涡之中，\n即便我不借助占卜也能看得出来。
I cannot ascertain the future with any degree of certainty, but I can plainly see which way the river cuts.
虽说我无法确定未来的结果，\n但能清楚地看到事物的发展趋势。
I would like to liberate its path of hindrances if possible.
要是可能的话，\n我会试着扫平前方的阻碍。
Oh! Excuse me, I refer merely to my interest in seeing your rather unique path through fate’s weave come to pass.
啊！不好意思，\n我只是想见识一下你独特的命格。
Well, that and a respectable appreciation for the quality of your character and company.
再就是我对你自身个性与品格欣赏。
It was not my intent to imply an interest in an... assignation, if that was what you were asking. Such passions are not my lot in life.
我没有在暗示…感情方面，\n我的人生也不会有这种强烈的感情。
Consider it a professional curiosity, if that might ease your concerns... or insecurities.
如果我说这只是职业上的好奇...\n能缓解你的焦虑和不安吗？
You are of note not merely for your personality and character –
不仅只是因为你的个性与品格...
though I confess some partiality to both – but for the briar-knot of fate you are embedded within.
我承认我的确喜欢你的这些特质...\n但关注你更多是因为\n你正深陷在命运的泥潭之中。
Many lives are wound around you. Around your fingers, or your throat, I wonder?
许多生命正与你紧密连结在一起，\n究竟是被你握于手中呢，\n还是紧紧地扼住了你的喉咙呢？
Put plainly, you’re important, I’m curious, and I like our conversations.
简单来讲就是 - 你很重要！\n而我，对你这份重要感到好奇，\n再就是我也很喜欢与你交流。
Even the ones I am not privy to I imagine are enlightening for my other half, and her revelations may lead to my own.
即便是命运中无法得知的细节，\n也会作为对她的启示而存在，\n我也可以在其中参悟良多。
Speaking of which, I am not merely here for pleasure. I had returned home for the express purpose of finding some clue as to my past.
其实，我到这里，并不是来旅行的。\n大部分内容，我都记不起来了，\n只知道这里是我的故乡...
I... cannot remember it. That this is my hometown, yes, and stray faint recollections from my youth, but beyond that nothing.
我只保留着一段模糊的，\n青年时期的回忆，\n而我回来这里，\n就是为了找寻关于我过去的线索。
Not until a comparatively luminous memory of riding on a train with my imitator at my side.
直到在来这边的火车上\n与我的模仿者并肩而坐时，\n我才想起一段相对清晰的记忆。
Whatever had happened before that leg of our journey, I do not remember.
但在这段旅程之外的内容，\n依然是一片空白。
I only know that I am real, she is false, and I journey to prove such.
我只知道我是真的，她是假的，\n我接下来的旅程，\n也是为了证明这一点。
Not at all. But I must keep the faith.
没有任何证据，\n但我必须坚持这个信念。
After all, if I am merely some animal that has deluded itself into humanity... well, the ethical quandaries alone would drive me mad.
毕竟，如果我只是某种...\n把自己视为人类的动物...\n单是伦理问题就能把我逼疯。
Oh, plenty. Scraps of childhood, as I said. Being on the train is the first full memory of my modern era.
就像我之前说的那样，\n有一些关于青年时期的零散片段，\n而火车上的相遇是第一段完整的记忆。
And from there, my memory is mostly whole – though the persistence and clarity of memory is something ethereal and unquantifiable.
从那之后我的记忆就基本正常了，\n当然，这只是我自己的感觉，\n我也不确定其他人的记忆\n是不是更稳定、清晰。
Perhaps mine are fragmented and faded compared to most.
毕竟我们永远都没办法\n对此做出准确的比较。
She likes to elude me, and, though I am loathe to admit it, I her.
她总喜欢躲着我，\n虽然我不愿承认，但我也躲着她。
It is rare we get more than a fleeting moment alone. Things are now... different, however.
我们很少会单独待在一起，\n不过，现在...或许不一样了。
Being here has driven my thoughts to doubt and darker places than that. I have found now answers.
来到这里之后，\n我的思维就在怀疑之中，\n逐渐被引导进更为黑暗的地方，\n并找到了现在这些答案。
The other Imogene has already left, unable to bear it any longer.
而另一个伊莫珍受不了这些，\n便选择离开这里。
She left a note stating simply that she knew what she must do, and that she goes now to a place of death and quiet oblivion.
她留下了一张写着去处的便条\n - 去一个死亡之地，\n静静地等待被人遗忘。
I choose to interpret it as guidance to find a <imp>burial ground or mausoleum</imp>, and not as her last goodbyes...
我觉得她是打算前往<imp>类似墓地的地方</imp>，\n并不是做最后的告别...
I’m unsure if there is a difference for us.
我...我不确定我们到底有多少不同。
\PN… I don’t know that we should exist.
\PN…\n我甚至不知道我们是否应该存在。
There is something fundamentally wrong with us. Our state is not natural, nor is it tenable.
我们的本质存在着根本性的问题，\n我们的状态既不自然，\n也难以为继。
...Ignore my macabre ramblings.
...别在意我的胡言乱语。
I will follow her, and find the proof of my true existence.
我会跟着她，\n找出我是真实存在的那个的证据。
If you wish to bear witness to these revelations and watch as her lies crumble around her, come find us.
她知道的比我更多，\n所以我必须要弄清楚！
She knows something dire that I do not. I must know what it is.
如果你想亲眼目睹真相，\n看到她的谎言四散瓦解，\n那就来找我们吧。
I'm trying to figure out why certain Avatars appear where they do.
我一直尝试着弄明白，\n为什么那些化身会出现在这里。
They're often species that'd make sense for the local ecology, but not always.
它们看起来都是正常的物种，\n当然也不能这么说。
Sometimes they're just.... somewhat off.
有时候它们只是...\n有些小变化。
Beats me.
想不明白。
I heard the stories, but it's still hard to believe that Avatars just... fade from existence when they're defeated.
虽然之前听别人说过，\n但我还是很难相信，\n化身在被击败后就会消失。
When I saw that you were winning, I was mentally prepared to grab a pickaxe and begin the cleanup efforts.
看到你取得胜利之后，\n我就做好重新回到岗位上的准备了。
Ohoh, does another fly enter my trap?
哦，又有猎物飞进我的陷阱了？
Watch yourself, you may find yourself mesmerized.
小心，不要入迷了哦。
Tsk! It seems like you were too hot to handle.
啧啧，已经热得有点受不了了。
Ah well, I suppose I could always ask Lainie to console me.
啊，我需要兰妮的安慰。
A spark. A flash. A line of roses.
旋转，跳跃，我闭着眼。
We should take our tango once more from the top.
或许我们应该再舞一曲。
But later, my dear.
但不是现在，亲爱的。
I've found myself as a bit of a historian.
我算是一个历史研究者吧。
I'm learning about important dates in history. The founding of Prizca, the fall of the monarchy.
我正在学习和研究这里的史诗，\n比如宏礼市的建立、王朝的陨落。
All of them are fascinating, but I believe my favorite is the one we'll have, no?
历史有着独特的魅力，\n但我还是更喜欢即将拥有的未来，\n你呢？
I wanted to be a Water-type trainer before, but now I don't.
我之前想成为一名水属性训练家，\n但现在我改主意了。
That's because I caught this Tentacool. It's super dumb. It's so dumb that I quit being a Trainer.
就因为我抓到的这只玛瑙水母，\n它真是...蠢到我连训练家都不想当了。
Maybe I'll want to be a Trainer again if I see a cool Water-type Pokemon, but if any Pokemon is as dumb as this Tentacool, I might die.
如果我能得到很酷的水系宝可梦，\n或许还会重燃梦想，\n但要是跟这玛瑙水母一样蠢，\n我可能刚进草丛就要死翘翘了。
Do you have a cool Water-type Pokemon that you could show me?
你有很酷的水系宝可梦吗？\n可以给我看看吗？
I'll give you my dumb Pokemon if you do.
只要你给我看看，\n我就把这只水母送你了。
That's cool, maybe.
好的，我就稍微抱有一丝希望吧。
Oh. That's dumb. You are dumb.
呃，什么蠢东西...\n跟你看起来一样蠢！
Wow. That Water-type is pretty cool.
哇，这只水系宝可梦也太酷了！
I still don't want to be a Trainer anymore.
但我还是不想当训练家。
Take this dumb Tentacool because I don't want to see or think or hear or touch it again.
把这只蠢货水母带走吧，\n我再也不想看到、想到、\n听到或者触摸到它了。
It is your dumb problem now.
现在这是你的蠢货了。
Ok. I'll keep holding on to this dumb Pokemon.
好吧，就让我继续\n跟这个蠢货待在一起吧。
Yeah.
好耶！解脱了！
Yes

No
不学
No thanks.
不买
Sure, I'll pay.

What the...
真特么...
Nevermind. Kid, I need some help.
小家伙，我需要协助。
That thing needs to go down, and I’m fresh out of Pokémon.
我们必须赶快解决那东西，\n但我已经没有可以出战的宝可梦了。
Please. We can’t let it escape.
交给你了，绝不能让它跑掉。
Don’t underestimate it.
还有，不要轻敌！
You'll need to send out <imp>two Pokemon at a time</imp> to even stand a chance.
只有<imp>同时派出两只宝可梦</imp>，\n才有击败它的机会。
I don’t have anything left. This is all on you.
我现在帮不上什么忙，\n只能靠你了。
I can’t thank you enough. Honest.
真是非常感谢。
That thing was what we’re calling an <imp>Avatar</imp>.
那东西就是我们所说的<imp>化身</imp>。
They started showing up a few months back.
几个月前，它们突然出现在野外...
It's rare to find a trainer that can take one on in a straight-up fight.
只有很少一部分训练家\n有实力与它们正面相持。
I heard one showed up in here and figured I had to do something before it hurt anyone, but I got cocky.
之前听说有这里一只化身，\n便打算在它伤人前消灭它，\n但我的准备没有做足...
Lemme heal your Pokemon.
让我帮忙治疗你的宝可梦吧。
Anyways, the name’s Lambert.
还有，我叫兰伯特。
I’ve got a feeling I’ll see you around the gym sometime soon, yeah?
想必我很快\n就会在道馆见到你了，对吧？
[Map27]
At first I was dissapointed that Makyan marts don't stock potions.
一开始我还非常费解，\n为什么马凯亚的商店里不卖药水。
Turns out this whole region loves their vending machines.
直到我感受到了\n来自自动售货机的关怀。
Everybody just buys Fresh Water, Soda, or Lemonade if they need extra healing on the road.
大家只需要买一些\n美味之水、果汁牛奶之类的饮料，\n就已经够用了。
Come to think of it, the Aid Kit makes potions even less needed nowadays.
何况现在大家手里都有急救包，\n更用不到普通的伤药了。
Oh, a trainer are you?
哦，你是训练家吗？
Would you be interested in taking my Sandshrew?
你有没有兴趣接手这只穿山鼠呢？
I brought it here from Alola, but I'm far too old to travel now, and it's getting restless.
这个我从阿罗拉地区\n带来的小家伙越来越不安分了，\n只是我年龄在这里摆着，\n不方便再东跑西颠。
I'd need $5000 in return. Sorry, but I've got to survive somehow!
如果你想要的话，就卖你$5000吧，\n也算是给我留点棺材本了！
What do you say?
你觉得怎么样？
I understand. That's fine, dear.
好吧，没关系。
You won't regret this.
你不会后悔的。
\PN hands over $5000 in exchange.
\PN将$5000交给对方。
Now to find my wife, wherever she's run off to.
现在该去找我老伴儿了。
Toodaloo!
再见咯！
Oh my, you don't have enough money.
你的钱不够啊。
No
不买
Yes
要了

You have me to thank for that, I put a decade of work into that beautiful machine.
这可都是我的功劳！\n我可是为了它付出了十年的心血。
My magnum opus. I probably don't have another one of those in me.
这是我的生涯中最杰出的作品，\n此生都很难再超越的作品！
Since then, I've started up a hobby tinkering with technical machines.

I caught a Meowth during my tour to Galar, to build my cat collection.
我在去伽勒尔地区旅游时\n捕捉了一只喵喵，\n用来丰富我的猫咪收藏。
It's far more trouble than it's worth. It keeps getting into fights with my other cats.

I've been thinking of adopting a new Pokemon. Another cat.
我一直在考虑领养一只\n新的宝可梦，\n收集另一只猫咪。
If you happen to have one, I'll trade you for this Galarian Meowth.

Ah well. I guess I'll have to try finding a new owner online.
唉，看来我得试着\n在网上给它找个新主人了。
I'll be here if you change your mind.

You think you can make it past my team? I hope you prepared!
你觉得能打赢我了？\n希望你真的做好准备了！
You really are incredible! I'm bummed out after taking a stomping like that.
你真的很厉害，\n都要把我的自信给打没了！
Seems like I bit off more than I could chew, but that isn't anything new. I'm off to find somewhere else to shack up.
或许我不该把自己逼得这么紧？\n管他的，是时候前往下一站了。
A promise is a promise, have a grab at my loot. I'm down to rematch if you swing by again.
一言既出驷马难追，\n如果你想要获得更多奖励，\n那就准备好后再来一场吧！
Don't think you've impressed me yet. I've still got a bone to pick with your team.
你虽然赢了，但还不够，\n继续让你的队伍变得更强吧。
I just got a MasterDex. I can't wait to use it during battles, it seems very helpful!
我刚刚得到了大师图鉴，\n已经迫不及待要在战斗中试用了，\n它一定能给我提供很多帮助！

On top of that, an Eevee Ticket from my stash of 'em. Redeemable in the stinkin' big city up north.

However, it won't be easy, as I have a <imp>full 6 Pokemon team</imp>.

Hey kid! I'm looking to collect some birds!
嘿，小家伙，能帮帮我吗？
I've been trying to find a Pidgey on this route, but I'm starting to think that there might not be any here.
我正在寻找一种叫波波的宝可梦，\n但我只知道这座岛上有...
They must be somewhere on this island, I can just feel it!

If I had my <imp>MasterDex</imp> with me, I'd be able to find the exact spots where Pidgey gather.
可惜我没带<imp>大师图鉴</imp>，\n不然就能查看它们的栖息地了。
If you can find one for me, I'll trade you this Pidove.

Back to searching then!

My parents were really excited for my first Pokemon. They gave me a few Pokeballs and sent me on my way.
当我爸爸妈妈得知\n我即将拥有第一只宝可梦时，\n都非常非常高兴，\n还给了我好几个宝可梦球。
But they were expecting me to get a Buneary or a Yamper or something, not a Vulpix.
但他们希望我得到的是卷卷耳\n或者来电汪之类的宝可梦，\n而不是六尾。
Apparently the Vulpix in this region are really mean. But not this one though, it's really nice!
听说这个地区的六尾好像都很坏...\n但是这只不同，它很友好！
Even if it's nice, my parents aren't letting me keep it...
可就算是这样，\n爸爸妈妈也不让我留着它…
Can you trade me for a Buneary or a Yamper? I want a Pokemon my parents are happy with.
你愿意用一只卷卷耳或\n来电汪和我交换吗？\n我想要换一只\n能让我爸爸妈妈满意的宝可梦\n（在箱子里选择宝可梦）。

This Vulpix needs a good home! I'll be here if you change your mind!

My Growlithe got spooked when I was talking it for a walk.
我的卡蒂狗在上次出去散步时\n受到了惊吓。
He ran off, and I wasn't able to find him again.
然后他就跑了，现在也没回来。
He's lost somewhere in Repora Forest.
他有可能在枯槁森林里迷路了。
Please find him, we've been together our entire lives.
请你帮忙去找找他吧，\n我这辈子不能没有他！
Here is his Pokeball, and his favorite type of treat.
这是他的宝可梦球，\n还有他最喜欢的食物。
He's a smart boy, so all you need to do is show him the treat and he'll return to his Pokeball.
他是个聪明的孩子，\n只要你给他这些吃的，\n他就会自己回到宝可梦球里去。

Yeah! One day, I'll grow just as strong as you! I'll help people just like you did.

Lots of Pokemon that live in the sewers help with waste treatment.
许多生活在下水道中的宝可梦\n都可以协助分解废料。
Too many Pokemon though, and the ecosystem might collapse.
但如果它们的数量过多的话，\n生态系统就有崩溃的风险。
We try to divert some waste to other places if we get too much of an influx.
所以我们会试着将一些废料\n转移到其他地方。
That way the population stays steady.
这样就能维持种群数量的稳定了。
I like to spend time here instead of the breakroom.

My my, you're a special one. Have you considered entering into the Tournament?
天啊，你很特别，\n考虑过参加竞技大会吗?
The Trainers this year are so intense.

Whoa whoa whoa there! You can't just stroll up to The Bench like that.
喂喂喂！\n你不能坐这把长椅！
This is The Bench, haven't ya heard? It's only got room for one winner, and that winner... is me.
你没听说过？\n这把长椅是属于这里的胜者的，\n而这个胜者...就是我！
Now I know that The Bench might be a bit intimidating for ya, so I've sweetened up the competition with a nice little relic I found.
我知道这长椅对你们来说，\n有很强的吸引力，\n更别说我还添加了一下小奖励。
Heard it goes for a pretty penny, so it might be worth taking me on. Wanna go at it?
看起来价格不菲哦，\n你就不想试试吗？
I've been stationed here to help in case of injury.

This plaza, right here, in the middle of Prizca, is where excellent Trainers come to battle, because it's cool.
在宏礼市中心的这个广场，\n与来自各地的训练家决一胜负。
Nobody, not me, not locals, not tourists, wants to stop battling.
无论是我，还是其他参赛者，\n没有人想要就此止步。
Excellent shots. Check online in a few days, you might have just battled in front of a few million viewers.
这个镜头真不错，\n过几天去网上看看，\n说不定你就火了！
We have some good footage, but lets stick around to make a B-Roll.
虽然我们已经拍了一些很棒的镜头，\n但还是再多补拍一些吧。
Professional Trainers from around the world are gathering here.
来自世界各地的\n职业训练家汇聚于此。
I'm technically a bit early, but it's worth it to see the best Makya has to offer.
虽然我来得早了些，\n但能看到马凯亚\n最好的一面还是很值得的。
I'm a former Makyan Tournament Champion.
我曾是马凯亚大赛的冠军。
No no, not in my youth--the festival has only been going on for eight years!
不，我不是说年轻的时候...\n这个节日庆典才举办了八年!
You never know when you'll reach your prime.
你永远不知道什么时候\n是你的巅峰状态。
Anyways, name's Ansel.
忘了介绍，我叫安塞尔。
It's just a hunch, but you seem like a Trainer that's looking for a good fight.
我感觉你很想来一场\n酣畅淋漓的对战。
You might want to check in on the other Champions.
那你应该去周围逛逛。
There's a few of us here in town.
这座城市除了我之外\n还有几位前任冠军。
Scilla's at the Ironclad Dojo, and Elise is always holed up in the Castle...
希拉在钢铁武馆，\n而伊莉莎一般都在城堡里...
Tell you what. If you manage to beat one of them in battle, I'll bring my team out of retirement for one last fight.
这样说吧，\n如果你能打败其中一人，\n那我就会叫回我退休的队伍，\n与你一决胜负。
Until then, enjoy your journey! You only get to do it once.
在那之前，好好享受你的旅程吧！\n你只有一次机会。
You might want to check in on the other Former Champions. There's a few of us here in town.
如果你对其他前冠军感兴趣的话，\n可以在这座城市找找看。
Scilla's at the Ironclad Dojo, and Elise is always holed up by the Castle...
希拉一般在钢铁武馆，\n而伊莉莎则通常在城堡里...
If you manage to beat one of them in battle, I'll bring my team out of retirement for one last fight.
如果你打败其中任意一人，\n我就会召回我的队伍，\n与你一决胜负。
I've heard the news. A Trainer beating any of the Former Champions makes waves in our circles.
我听说了，\n打败任何一位前冠军\n在我们的圈子里都会引起轰动。
I've got a promise to keep \PN. Got my team back from a cushy retirement -- no small task!
我答应过\PN你。\n不过让我的队伍从舒适惬意的\n退休生活中回复战斗状态...\n这可不是件容易的事啊！
Wouldn't want to keep them waiting for too long. Fancy to give us one last skirmish?
我不想让它们等太久，\n愿意与我们一决胜负吗？
I'm as antsy as a Durant. Get ready soon!
我跟铁蚁一样没什么耐心，\n快快准备好！
Then let's waste no time. Ready yourself!
那我们就别浪费时间了！
Ha! Haha! What a rush!
哈哈！太畅快了！
Two years of sitting on my bum would do that! I think my whole team is gonna feel sore tomorrow!
两年没训练输了也是正常！\n我感觉我的老伙计们\n明天都得腰酸背痛了！
You've done well, \PN. Any longer and I might have needed to call it quits early. Don't handle adrenaline well in my old age.
打的真不错，\PN。\n要是再打久点，\n可能就得中间叫暂停了，\n我年纪摆在这里，心脏受不了。
I'm sure you're not satisfied just a single battle from me, but that's all I got in me. Retirement's just a little too comfy!
我知道你还想多打几场，\n但我只能奉陪到此，\n毕竟退休生活实在是太安逸了！
Let me make up for it. I'll ask Praveen to take my place.
不过作为补偿，\n就让普拉文替吧。
Child's got no respect for elders, but he's not a bad battler.
那小子虽说不尊重长辈，\n但他打得还不赖。
He'll probably be training in the Sandstone Estuary. No doubt he'll stop whatever he's doing to face you.
他现在可能在沙岩河口训练，\n不过你放心，有架打的话，\n他肯定会立即停下手头的事。
In the meantime, I need a nap. Farewell!
现在我要休息一会儿了，\n再见！
I love watching all the friendly matches that happen during the festival.
我喜欢战斗节庆典。
You get to see all sorts of battle strategies and team compositions.
在这里能看到各种各样的\n队伍组合和战斗策略。
There's always something to learn.
总有能学到的东西。
I have more Flying-type Pokemon, but I left them back at home so I could diversify!
我有很多的飞行系宝可梦，\n但我把它们都留在家里了，\n这样增加我队伍的多元性！
Actually, I should stick to types that I know...
或许，我应该坚持使用\n自己熟悉的属性...
Maybe I need to find even more types!
也许我需要收集更多\n其他属性的宝可梦！
Should I branch out into Electric-type? Fire-type?
电还是火呢？
The Tournament has been growing in size and prestige every year.
战斗节庆典的规模和声势\n每年都在上升。
Makyans have been battling here ever since Trainers became a thing.
自从训练家这种职业出现，\n马凯亚人就一直在这里战斗。
However, it got seriously large and respected once LuxTech started pumped in a bunch of sponsor money.
当然那时候还没有庆典这一说，\n声势和规模，\n自然是光华科技参与之后，\n逐年打上去的。
Wow, a wallhacker! #content
哇哦，穿墙哥！ #content
Anybody non-Trainers who walk through this Plaza, by accident of course, is in for a shock once they realize where they are.
任何一个无意间穿过这里的\n非训练家游客，\n在意识到这是什么地方后，\n都会感到大吃一惊。
Most Pokemon who wander through here are caught by Trainers unless they were already part of another Trainer's party.
如果是野生宝可梦出现在这里，\n那它很快就会被抓住。
Evolution Market

I'm trying to set up my stall, but this crowd won't leave!

I've got a whole fireworks thing planned for the Tournament.
我为大赛准备了\n一整套烟火表演。
This booth is a little side thing.

You cheated not only the game, but yourself.

You didn't grow.
你没有成长。
You didn't improve.
你没有进步。
You took a shortcut and gained nothing.
你走了一条捷径，\n却一无所获。
You experienced a hollow victory. Nothing was risked and nothing was gained.

It's sad you don't know the difference.
可惜你理解不到其中的区别。
You're a natural on camera kid.
你在镜头前表现得很自然。
At least you seem like it.
至少我是这么觉得的。
If you aren't, you better get used to it fast if you want to do well at the Tournament.
如果你只是在强装镇定的话，\n最好尽快适应它，\n不然很难在竞技大会中取得好成绩。
I always look forward to battling here each year.
我每年都在期待着今天。
Your team is so exciting to see! I'll be looking out for you.

After taking that slamming I gotta go hit the routes for some training.
我刚刚被打击到了，\n现在正考虑外出历练。
But for now, I'm just a part of the crowd. Maybe you'll fight me again during the Tournament.
如今我只是一位普通观众了，\n或许我们之后还会在赛场上见面。
What about The Bench? Ah, I wouldn't worry. The Bench calls to people. Someone will answer The Bench eventually.
至于这张长椅？\n哈哈，它的吸引力\n会引诱下一个胜者来占有它！
Hey, 'miring my team?
对我的队伍很好奇？
Of course you are. You're looking at the current ruler of The Bench.
难怪，毕竟你现在面前的，\n就是长椅的现任统治者。
OK! OK! We got a winner here!
好！好！好！\n现在这里出现了一位新的胜者!
The Bench is yours, treat it well. Feel the comfort of superiority flow through that seat.
这长椅是你的了，请善待它，\n感受这种上流的优越感吧。
Eyo, you beat me. But you didn't get me.
哎呀，你打赢了，\n但并没有完全击溃我。
Let's see if we can't get another round in. I ain't about to cede The Bench to any ol' schmuck.
找个时间我们再来一场吧，\n我可不想把长椅让给一个弱者。
Hit me up again whenever, I'll be ready.
过会儿再来，我准备一下。
Alright, that'll get you sorted.
你现在可以自主行动了。
Crowd should disperse soon enough once the other guys tell 'em that the coronation is on hold.
只要大家得知加冕仪式暂停，\n人群很快就会散去。
Anyways, you should head over ASAP.
总之，你还是尽快过去吧。
Tamarind doesn't like when her requests take too long, believe me.
塔玛琳一直不喜欢等别人。
It looks like it's resisting an urge to ignite the fireworks!
看样子它在强忍着\n点燃烟花的冲动！
Seeing all kinds of Pokemon in one place is so cool!
能看到各种不同的宝可梦\n聚在一起真是太酷了！
Whew, that's enough battling for now. I'm gonna go sit down somewhere.
呼，打累了，\n我要找个地方休息下。
Your Pokemon are awesome! Let's battle again later.
你的宝可梦很厉害！\n我们待会再战吧。
Your Pokemon are rad, I need to see them agian.

Point is, surprise! You get two starters: One standard three-stage Grass, Water or Fire, you know the drill, but also a Normal-type.
重点是，你的待遇比预想中要好，\n你可以获得两只初始宝可梦：\n一只是水火草属性任选，\n还有一只是一般系的宝可梦。
But first things first...
但在那之前…
The <imp>MasterDex</imp> is a Pokédex, but it comes preloaded with data on every non-legendary species.
这个<imp>大师图鉴</imp>里面，\n预装了所有非传说宝可梦的资料，
Moves, Abilities, stats, evolutions - it's all in there.
招式，特性，数据，进化型等等，\n这里面都能查到。
Now go pick out your first starter. I ain't got all day.
现在快去挑你的第一只宝可梦吧，\n我还有其他事情要忙。
OK, next is the Normal-types.
然后是那只一般系的...
You may want to look these up in your MasterDex, using the <imp>search feature</imp>.
不确定的话可以先看一下\n它们在图鉴中的<imp>数据和介绍</imp>。
Skwovet, Zigzagoon, or Patrat?
贪心栗鼠、蛇纹熊和探探鼠，\n你打算选哪个？
Alright, come back to me when you know what you want.
那你拿定主意再说。
Sure, good choice. Now, uh... oh, yeah.
不错的选择，那现在...\n哦，对了...
Take this.
拿上这个。
Makyan invention. It will regenerate held items automatically after battles.
这是由马凯亚人发明的装置，\n它可以在战斗结束后\n自动生成一个被消耗掉的持有道具。
Berries, Gems, you name it.
比如说树果、宝石什么的。
Aaand here's some Poké Balls.
最后就是这几个宝可梦球。
Gonna be honest, I'm here on business too, so I really don't have another minute to spare on you.
坦白讲，我也是来这里出差的，\n所以真的没有时间和你闲聊。
There's a whole mess stirring on the coast up north, but that's - don't worry about that. Worry about getting your badges.
现在北部海岸那边一片混乱...\n但那跟你没什么关系，\n你只要想着怎么获得徽章就行了。
There's a Gym here, but <imp>Lambert</imp>, the leader, is out.
这里也有一个道馆，\n但是馆主<imp>兰伯特</imp>出门了。
I heard he went west to <imp>Bluepoint Beach</imp>.
我听说他去西边的<imp>蓝莹海滩</imp>了...
I've got bigger problems on my plate, though, so scram.
我没时间帮你解决这些问题，\n所以，自己玩去吧。
What are you waiting for? I got them laid out all nice and everything!
该给的该说的我都已经做完了，\n还不赶紧开始你自己的冒险去？
Didn't I say to leave me alone?
我说了别来打扰我！
Don't bother. I didn't have time to grab any room service.
里面是空的，\n不用费尽心思找食物了，
Not that I'd let you have any either way.
就算有我也不会给你。
No
算了
Yes
选它
Not Now
稍等一下

I've been trying to learn every sport lately.
我最近一直在学习各项运动。
Judo, baseball, tennis, even lacrosse. I've managed to hold my own against players in each of them.
我会柔道、棒球、网球，\n甚至学会了长曲棍球 ，\n我现在在这些项目都有准职业水准。
It's a long but rewarding process. My next project is figure skating. 
这是一个漫长但有回报的过程，\n我的下一个项目就是花样滑冰。
That lady over there is killing it, so I'm trying to copy her movements.
那位女士的表现太出色了，\n所以我在试着模仿她的动作。
The lake here used to be pretty. The ice rink is nice, but it just doesn't have the same appeal.
以前这个湖非常漂亮，\n虽说天然的溜冰场也不错，\n但我觉得没有之前吸引力大！
I remember this place started freezing a few years back, right before Team Chasm disbanded.
大概是几年前开始结冰的...\n就在裂隙队解散前夕。
I wouldn't put it past them to be behind it, they got their hands in everything.
我怀疑是他们搞的鬼，\n毕竟他们什么事都要插两手。
I used to be a hockey player, so ice skating is something that was natural to me.
我以前是个曲棍球运动员，\n所以滑冰对我来说毫无难度。
But I have to admit, figure skaters have something figured out.
但我必须承认，\n花滑运动员还是有点东西的。
Doing tricks on the ice feels great.
在冰上做出那些动作真的很带感！
Hey kid. If you're looking for your next adventure, I wouldn't advise going this way.
嘿，孩子，\n如果你准备前往下一站，\n那我不建议你走这条路。
An Avalugg avatar has appeared in the Ice Cave.
冰之洞穴里出现了冰岩怪化身。
If you do go in, you legally absolve the Rangers and the Svait Rescue Operation of responsibility.
如果你执意要这么做，\n那么在你进去的一瞬间，\n义军和霜皑救援队\n就不需要再对你的人身安全负责了。
"Svait, experience an eternal snow season!"
"霜皑镇，雪花市的姊妹城！"
"Sister of Icirrus City."
"体验永恒的雪季！"
The Ice Cave is really a unique phenomenon. It spews out extremely cold air.
冰之洞窟里喷出的寒冷气流，\n改变了附近区域的气候。
It cools the area down so much that we get snowfall most of the year.
所以这里才会\n一年四季被冰雪覆盖，\n这也是马凯亚下雪最多的地方，\n必齐纳山山顶上还多。
In fact, we get more snow even than Mt. Kilna.
至于冰之洞窟形成的原因，\n只能说是大自然的鬼斧神工了。

I've been coming to this lake once a year for over thirty years now.
三十多年了，\n我每年都会来这个湖一次。
Seeing this place grow and change has been both strange and exciting.
看着这个地方不断变化成长，\n感觉既奇怪又兴奋。
The ice rink used to be a lake, yet it's entirely frozen now.
这个溜冰场以前是个湖，\n现在已经完全冻结实了。
This little pond stays unfrozen however.
但旁边这个小池塘\n却始终没有结冰。
What could have caused such an abnormal change in temperature in such a concentrated area?
到底是什么原因\n才让这里的气候出现异常的？
Ugh. I don't really get how to do this whole ice skating thing.
啊...我真的不会滑冰...
ACHOO!
啊嚏！
I think I've also caught a cold...
好像还感冒了…
There you are.
给你。
I’ve had a chance to look more at the data on that USB.
我本有机会进一步查看U盘上的内容。
The people you got this from really didn’t bother to scrub anything off of it, huh?
我很怀疑之前拿到它的人，\n真的没有删除些什么吗？
I feel a little silly for spending all that time in the stacks.
我真是...太傻了，\n竟然在书堆里花了那么多时间。
All these findings and life's work worth of knowledge makes you feel very, very, small.
所有毕生心血换来的发现和知识，\n让我觉得自己...非常...非常渺小。
Are they satisfied to just, never act on the knowledge that they’ve obtained?
难道他们就能忍得住，\n不去就这些知识而采取些行动吗？
Hey. This might be an odd question, but…
哈，你或许觉得这个问题有些奇怪，\n但是...
Could you come and talk to me again when you have 4 or less Pokemon in your party?
这样，你先放下至少两只宝可梦，\n然后再过来跟我谈谈吧。
I think it’d be best if you come back when you have 4 or less Pokemon in your party.
我觉得你最好先确保，\n队伍里少于四只宝可梦再过来。
Great. Sorry.
非常抱歉。
Most trainers I’ve seen around the region only use parties of 4, so I felt a bit… Intimidated by your overwhelming strength.
因为我看到附近的训练家，\n大多数都只有四只宝可梦的队伍...\n所以我对你压倒性的力量有点...怕。
I have another possibly odd question for you.
另外...有个奇怪的问题要问你。
Have you ever caught a Legendary Pokemon before?
你抓到过传说中的宝可梦吗？
I was dreading that.
我担心的就是这个。
I don’t think I have it in me to let you become a hoarder like Team Chasm was.
我不认为我希望你成为\n像裂隙队那样的“收集者”。
These are forces of nature you’re messing with. And they need to be respected as such.
我们既然要应对大自然的力量，\n也应当尽可能地尊重它们。
You need to know where you stand.
你要明白自己的立场。
You need to know your place.
你要明白自己的位置。
Oh, good. Right, yeah!
那太好了，真的！
That’d be ridiculous if you did. It’d be like owning an Avatar.
如果你真的得到那些力量，\n谁知道什么时候又会有新的化身，\n或者类似化身的存在出现。
But… The Seekers were able to work with The Crafter to attain some sort of harmony with those.
不过...那些探索者如果...\n能够跟它们打成某种合作关系...
Even if I can find beauty in the primalness… Somehow, humanity managed to take control.
那究竟是依靠什么，\n才让人类在自然的力量面前，\n逐渐掌控了一切的呢？
…If anyone should be worthy of inheriting the legacy of the Seekers, it's me.
…哼哼，如果有谁，\n有资格继承他们的遗产，\n那非我莫属了！
I’m the one who put in all the time reading the research here.
花了那么多的时间研究报告，\n才使得一切得以重见天日。
I’m the one who picked their bones clean.
这一切都是我一直以来的努力！
If anyone should be worthy of inheriting the legacy of the Seekers, it's me.
…哼哼，如果有谁，\n有资格继承他们的遗产，\n那非我莫属了！
Even when I pull out all the stops, when I try my best to defang you, you bite down anyway.
我知道，即便我使尽浑身解数，\n想尽一切办法要阻止你，\n你依然会跟过来的。
You’re not human… You know, for a moment, it really flashed in my mind that maybe I could do something with all of this.
我脑海中有一瞬间，\n甚至怀疑过，你到底是不是人类...\n甚至还考虑过能不能利用这一点。
That I could attain my own facsimile of overwhelming power...
考虑能不能得到这一份，\n能够碾压我的力量的摹本...
But you’re just too strong.
但你还是太强了。
I’m all bark and no bite…
而我，就是个只会叫的弱者…
I’m so sorry.
抱歉。
I don’t know what came over me, \PN. I really lost myself for a moment.
其实我也不清楚到底怎么了，\n\PN，刚刚一瞬间...\n我仿佛失去了自己的意志。
Shows how easy it could’ve been for the Seekers and Team Chasm to let this go to their heads.
难怪当年的裂隙队...\n还有探索者，有那么多\n令人感觉疑惑又莽撞的行为。
Here, let me heal your team up.
来，让我治疗你的宝可梦。
Let’s go find what we came here for together.
然后一起去找这次的目的地吧。
Yes
抓过
No
没有

You know what? I'd best be spending me money instead of losin' it!
早知道我就把钱花掉了，\n现在都便宜了你！
Well, there goes me shore leave money.
完了，休假资金没了。
I developed a multi-hit attack during Lambert's self-defense course.
我在兰伯特的防身术课堂上，\n学会了多重攻击。
I don't get much chance to battle, though.
不过我根本没什么用上的机会。
Would you allow me the chance to teach my Multi Strike attack to your Pokemon?
需要我将多重攻击\n教给你的某只宝可梦吗？
It should be simple enough for many Pokemon, mostly Normal-type.
很多宝可梦都能学会这招，\n尤其是一般系的那些。
Ah, excellent!
啊，太好了!
Ah, pardon my indulgence in even asking.
啊，打扰了。
Wait a minute sis! This loser doesn't even have two pokemon!
等下妹妹！\n这个菜鸡连两只宝可梦都没有！

我觉得自己还是很擅长对战的！\n要不要见识一下？
You... You're quite the battler...\wt[20]
你…你真厉害…\wt[20]
I-I'm going to leave now.
我...我得走了。
You, defeat me? My goodness!
这...怎么可能？我...输了？
Wow, you found me again!
哇，你又找到我了！
A loss is a loss, I guess I owe you that second TM now.
输了就是输了，\n这个技能机也给你了。
I'll head back to town now. That was a fun game. I'm pretty worked up, hehe.
真好玩！嘿嘿！\n不过现在我要回去了，\n今天好开心！
Wild Pokemon keep defeating my Pokemon!
我的宝可梦连野生的都打不过！
Why is catching Pokemon so hard?!
为什么抓宝可梦这么难！
Yes
学
No

Each Pokemon has their own Personality Traits.
每只宝可梦都有自己的独特之处。
Bonding with a Pokemon, and discovering what makes them unique, can be such a source of joy.
发现它们的优势，\n与它们建立起紧密的羁绊，\n就是旅途上最快乐的事。
Don't worry about your battles. No matter the personality, any Pokemon can be an excellent battler.
另外，不要畏惧对战，\n无论你拥有怎样的宝可梦，\n它们都可以在战斗中发挥作用。
Use whatever Pokemon you connect with the most.
所以尽请使用你更喜欢的孩子吧。
Hello, and welcome to the Casaba Villa Pokécenter!
欢迎来到甜瓜宝可梦中心！
Oh, you're new to Makya, are you?
你是刚刚来到马凯亚吗？
An emergency measure was introduced recently to help trainers who might be in danger from avatar attacks.
因为最近化身肆虐，\n为了帮助训练家们应对威胁，\n上面出台了一项紧急政策。
According to that new measure, I'm supposed to give you this.
根据规定，这个是你的了。
Use this Aid Kit to heal your entire party!
这是一个急救包，\n可以让你的宝可梦恢复健康！
Fainted Pokemon will be revived, their statuses will be healed, and their PP will be restored as well.
濒死状态的宝可梦会恢复活力，\n其他的异常状态也可以消除，\n就连招式PP也会回满。
It has a limited number of uses, but any nurse or other healer you meet will restore its supplies back up to full!
虽然使用次数有限，\n但每一位医护人员\n都会帮你恢复它的使用次数。
Thank you for your patience while I explained all of that.

I’ve got a Pokémon that needs fixing up, and, uh, it’s pretty bad.
我有只宝可梦需要治疗，\n它现在的情况很糟糕。
Uh, well – listen, if you promise to share I’ll let it out of its ball.
呃...好吧，\n只要你答应帮忙，\n我就把它从球里放出来。
I can’t take it to a Pokécenter because… you’ll see.

You hand over some of your Aid Kit medicine.

You hand over a Fresh Water.

Oh, uh, you, uh… you don’t have any either.

抱歉打扰了，\n我猜你也有自己的难处，\n祝你好运。

This is why I didn’t just go to a Pokécenter.
这就是我没有直接去\n宝可梦中心的原因。
It’s a Phione. Don’t bother looking it up in your 'dex – they aren’t even real.
它是一只霏欧纳，\n不用在图鉴里找了，\n它们理论上只存在于神话中。
Least, that’s what people say. Just a myth.
反正大家都这么说。
And, y’know how Makya is – I wasn’t about to show it off in public.
你应该大概知道\n马凯亚的风气是什么样的了吧？\n我可不想让太多人看到它。

Dumb luck. Stumbled across a Manaphy one night and it gave me an egg.
纯属运气，那天晚上，\n我偶然遇到了一只玛纳霏，\n它给了我一枚蛋。
Didn't know if I was cut out for that, but couldn't exactly turn it down.

Figured it was a chance to do right, y’know?
我觉得这是做好事的机会。
Phione? They’re the children of Manaphy.
霏欧纳？它是玛纳霏的孩子。
That’s what I’ve heard anyways. Can’t find any solid records online of someone catching one.
反正我也是听说的，\n在网上找不到什么可靠记录。
Not everyone even believes they exist. But, uh, hey, this one’s real.
甚至很多人都不相信它真实存在，\n但显然，它是真实的。
Well, you helped me out, didn’t you?
对，并且你也帮助我了，不是吗？
Don’t really seem like a Pokémon thief to me. So, yeah, I guess I trust you.
我看得出你不像那些小偷，\n所以就向你寻求帮助了。
I was trying to train it up, but it’s a pretty fragile little thing.
我试着训练它战斗，\n但是它好像并不擅长这些。
Didn’t hatch all that long ago, and, well… I’m used to training hardier Pokémon.
一是它刚孵出来没多久...\n二是我习惯了训练强大的宝可梦。
Still trying to learn to be a li’l more gentle, you know?
我应该试着变得温柔一点。
Wait, guess I haven’t actually introduced myself.
对了，我还没自我介绍呢。
My name’s <imp>Eifion</imp>, and this is my Phione. How about you?
我叫<imp>艾维恩</imp>，\n它你已经知道了，我的霏欧纳。\n你呢?
…Well, \PN, it’s nice meeting you.
…嗯，\PN，很高兴认识你。
You too, \pfp. I should be heading out, but thank you, seriously. You bailed me out big time here.
总之，\pfp，我应该走了，\n真的非常感谢你的帮助。
Won’t forget it. See you around!
我不会忘记今天的一切，\n后会有期!
AGHHH!!!
啊啊啊！！！

Sorry, I thought you were an Avatar!
抱歉，我还以为是化身...
I was so stupid, I thought I could win against the Beartic that's blocking the way down there.
我真是太自大了，\n本以为能打败那只冻原熊。
It wiped out my whole team.
结果我的宝可梦都失去战斗力了。
You handled that Beartic with ease, incredible!
你竟然能解决那只冻原熊，\n真是太厉害了！
You didn't risk it just to help me, did you?
你冒这个险不是为了帮我吧?
Well, this is awkward...
嗯，这可真是尴尬啊...
Abraporter, activate!
凯西传送器，启动！
You really did a number on that avatar.
你解决了那只化身？
Can't afford to be trapped in here, since I got this Origin Ore to fence.
我可不能被困在这里，\n我还得卖了这块起源矿石。
Yeah, I stole it. What of it?
你没猜错，是我偷的，\n但是又能怎样？
Or maybe you're interested?

5k, since I like ya.
一口价$5000，\n因为我看你还挺顺眼的。
Your loss.

You hand over $5000 in exchange.
将$5000交给对方。
See ya later. Not!

Don't mess with me like that, you don't even have the cash.
别逗我了，你就这点钱。
You looking for the missing package?
你在找丢失的包裹？
Too bad, I'm gonna find it first!
哼，我会率先找到的！
I'm here unofficially, so there won't be any paper trail linking me to this fiasco.
一次非正式的战斗而已，\n不会有任何一张纸记录我的败北。
Wait, paper trail? Hmm...
等下...纸？嗯...
All of this could have been avoided with better planning...
如果我再考虑地周密一点...
Some loose paper displaying the LuxTech logo.
一些散落在地上的纸张，\n上面印有光华科技的标志。
I've been waiting for days to do maintenance on these lights.
从接到修理这些路灯的委托算起，\n已经等了好几天了。
Wasn't gonna risk it with that Avatar making its home here.
我可不想冒险靠近那个化身。
I appreciate you taking care of that for me!
谢谢你帮我解决掉它！
Leaving through -- oh. You -- you’re looking for something down here.
我正要离开这里——哦。\n你——你在这里找什么东西。
Come back and, uh, I’ll still be... around.

嘿，未来的冠军！
Lambert's gym is inspired by his old days of breaking up brawls and knockin' skulls!
这个道馆是馆主兰伯特\n根据以前在街头干架\n的亲身经历设计出来的！
Therefore his gym focuses on Fighting-type and Dark-type Pokemon.
所以，这里是格斗和恶属性的道馆。
You're new to Makya, right? Focusing on two types is standard for gyms in this region.
你是刚来马凯亚的吧？\n这个地区道馆一般都会\n使用两种属性的宝可梦。
If you want to take Lambert to task, Fairy-type Pokemon are your best bet.
说回到兰伯特这边，\n要想更轻松地对付他，\n妖精属性无疑是你的最佳选项。
Bug-type and Flying-type Pokemon are also useful!
当然虫系和飞行系也不错！
Hope that helps!
希望这些情报能帮到你！
You knocked some sense into him.
你把他打醒了。
Congrats!
恭喜！
You looking for a rematch? I’ll oblige you.
想要再来一局吗？
Ah, so you made it to me. Congrats.
啊，你终于来了，首先恭喜你。
Now, uh, things work a little differently ‘round here. Us gym leaders ain’t about to pull any punches.
其次，这里的道馆挑战稍有些不同，\n我们可不会吝惜自己的拳头。
Our teams have some bite to them, so make sure you’re ready before you try and take me on in a brawl.
我们的队伍肯定有很强的攻击力，\n所以你在挑战之前，\n一定要做好相应的准备。
So, what can I do you for? You ready for a proper fight?
现在，你准备好了吗？
Ah, you’re killing me. Well, c’mon back when you’re ready.
哈？那你来干什么？\n等你做好准备再来吧。
Oh, I’ve got a good feeling about this bout.
我对这场比赛很有信心。
You ain’t facing Gym Leader Lambert today.
你今天面对的不是道馆馆主兰伯特。
No, this is former Team Chasm Captain Lambert, at your service.
前裂隙队部长兰伯特，\n接受你的挑战。
Let’s dance!

Good choice. Well, up until now we’ve been best buds, but it’s time to show you what Makya’s taught me.
明智的选择。\n在此之前，我们是并肩作战的伙伴，\n但现在，我要向你展示\n我在马凯亚的毕生所学了。
I haven’t gone soft just yet.
燃烧吧，我的斗志！
Ready? Go!
准备好了吗？
I don’t know what to say. That was -- you’re the best trainer I’ve ever faced, and that’s including the kid that dismantled our entire Team.
我不知道该说什么好了。\n你刚才的表现简直离谱，\n比我见过的任何一位训练家都要强，\n包括那个解散我们组织的臭丫头。
You <i> dropped </i> me, like it wasn’t even a struggle.
整场战斗都在你的<i>掌控</i>之中，\n我现在马后炮都找不出获胜的可能。
Take it -- it’s the Loyalty Badge.
收下它吧 - 这是忠诚徽章。
I’ll heal up your Pokémon and get out of your way.
我会帮你的宝可梦恢复状态。
Actually... let's go talk at my house.
另外...去我家聊聊吧。
Well, you sure proved yourself this time. Feels like you could take on my entire team and then some.
哇，你现在也太特喵强了。\n我感觉就算再多几只宝可梦\n也不够你打的。
Want me to call up some of my old buddies next time? Oh, whatever.
下次需要我召集一些老伙计一起吗？\n算了，那不太好...
Let me heal your Pokémon, and why don’t you let me brood over how humiliating this is.
让我来治愈你的宝可梦吧，\n顺便体味一下今天有多丢人。
Impressive. You’re a damn sight better than most of the folks ‘round here.
真不错，你的实力已经足够强了。
Might even be Champion material.
说不定你还真是冠军的料。
Let me get your Pokémon back into tip-top shape.
但现在还是先让我\n帮你治疗一下宝可梦吧。
As for you, here: the Loyalty Badge. It ain’t much, but you earned it.
给，这个就是忠诚徽章，\n虽说不是什么大不了的东西，\n但也是你用实力赢得的。

People make a big deal out of it, but it wasn’t anything special. Never wanted to use a prosthetic, either.
人们总是对此大惊小怪，\n其实没什么特别的，\n她也从没考虑过使用义肢。
She’d much rather have her Pokémon help her out.
她更习惯让宝可梦帮助她。
Very well-trained. Helped out around the house plenty.

She got Artemisia as a Togepi when she was young. Her starter, if you wanna call it that.

She spent all her free time down in the caves, and one day she was trailing a li’l Larvitar too.

Oh, that. Yezera never did get along with humans so well.
说到这个，叶泽拉从来\n都不太喜欢和人们相处。
Could barely handle going to school. It wasn’t until she started adventuring that she made a friend.
她完全无法适应学校的生活，\n直到开始冒险后，\n她才交到了一个朋友。
Alessa – maybe you’ve seen her? Good kid.
阿莱莎...或许你见过她？\n她是个好孩子。
Yezera always did disappear when she got stressed, though. Nowadays is no different.
不过在叶泽拉有压力的时候，\n她总会突然消失，包括现在。
Wish she could talk to me... but I’m no different than every other human, I s’pose.

Woah there Trainer, you're 'miring Makya's top professional fish wrestler.
哇哦，训练家，\n你正在和马凯亚最顶尖的\n职业鱼类摔跤手打说话。
I'm all the brawn I'd ever need, but my operation could use an injection of brains.
我的肌肉已经足够发达了，\n但我终于意识到在行动中\n还需要一点头脑。
I'm thinkin' a Psychic-type 'mon might do the trick.
也许那些超能属性的宝可梦\n就能帮到我？
You got one of those on hand? I'll trade you my latest dub: a Remoraid.
你有这样的宝可梦吗？\n我可以用我最近捕获的\n铁炮鱼和你交换\n（在箱子里选择宝可梦）。

I wonder if I can teach this 'mon how to wrestle...

I don't want to be picking flowers! I want to be ominous and creepy for a villainous master! Here, let me show you!
我不想再做摘花的小女孩了！\n我要变成阴森可怖的邪恶大魔王！\n来，让我给你瞧瞧吧!
Wow! Do you, by chance, have need of an ominous fighting maid for your mansion? No? Fine, I'll go.
哇！你需不需要一位\n神秘的战斗女仆来保卫城堡呢？\n不需要？那...好吧...那我走。
Aww. Maybe if I was a better trainer Team Chasm wouldn't've collapsed...
唉，如果我能更强一些，\n裂隙队就不会解散了...
These graves have been here since before Team Chasm. I didn't let them poke around here, and I won't let you!
这些坟墓早在裂隙队成立之前就存在了。\n我不允许他们来冒犯这里，\n还有你也一样！
Maybe the spirits would return to their slumber if I stopped attacking people in their home... my apologies.
也许如果我停手，\n那些幽灵会回到它们的安息之地……\n对不起了。
Fine! If the spirits take you away, don't come crying to me!
好啊！如果鬼魂把你带走，\n可别来找我哭!！
Behold! The power of sea, air, and land!
见识下海陆空的力量吧！
The way I see it, the ocean is surrounded. What's under the ocean? That's right, more earth.
在我看来，海洋才是被包围的，\n你想想，在海底更下面是什么？\n没错，是更多陆地！

Guarding the bridge seems kinda pointless now that you can do that, huh?
既然你能做到这种地步，\n那我守桥就没有任何意义了。
Hey, no trying to distract me from my job!
嘿，别想让我分心！
Call me the 'sue' chef, because I'm gonna sue Helena for damages... or something...
叫我"起诉"大厨吧，\n因为我要起诉海伦娜\n赔偿我的损失…
Are you just -- fine, yeah, go on ahead. Just don't step on the bridge!
你...还好吧，那你快走吧。\n别待在桥上了!
Helena's instructions were quite clear. Try to cross the bridge, we battle you.
海伦娜指示我们在这里，\n阻击所有试图过桥的训练家。
When we've healed up, you'll be sorry for crossing us--er, the bridge.

Sure she does! We get to guard an entire bridge! Speaking of which, depart the bridge at once!
她当然知道！\n我们要守好这座桥！\n说到这，你给我赶快下去！
I'm really starting to think we aren't cut out for this.
我觉得我们真不适合干这个。
Yeah, if she thinks we'll stay out here for another week, I've got a bridge to sell her... did that even make sense?
嗯，要是她要求我们在这里待几周，\n那我到时是不是能把这座桥卖给她...\n真够可笑的。
...Let's just go double-check.
...再仔细检查一下情况吧。
Oh, shut up. Let's just get back to the Pokecenter.

I hear a Meowth makes you 33% luckier -- so now I'm guaranteed to win!
听说喵喵会给我带来\n三分之一的幸运，\n所以现在我肯定能赢！

I bought this outfit and everything. It would feel quite strange were I to remain Dragon-less...

My peaceful stroll through the park is ruined by all this racket!

You need specific Tokens to buy the starters.
这里只支持代币支付。
If we just sold them with cash, they would be bought instantly.
如果我们接受现金，\n那会被立刻抢购一空的。
We'd have to worry about Pokemon scalping.

I make sweets that get sold at the coffee shop. Business is slow, though, so I'm spending time here.

I'm not sure how I did it, but my bike is up there, and I am down here.
我也不清楚发生了什么，\n只知道我的自行车在那上面，\n而我却站在这里。
It's all a blur. I was in the moment. A flow state.

I can't decide where I want to battle.
我不知道该走哪条路了。
The Trainers to the east are easier.
东边的训练家比较简单。
But if I don't go west now, I'll have to go counter-clockwise around Mt. Kilna.

I've heard rumors that if you earn the trust of those birds, they'll fly you other places.
我听到传言说，\n只要你赢得了那些鸟儿的信任，\n它们就会带你飞到其他地方。
No where outside of Makya, though. Shouldn't worry about it undercutting my line of work, I guess.
不过，并不能到马凯亚之外的地方，\n这应该不会影响到我的工作吧。

They're a popular request, but market fluctuations left us with a bit too much excess.

Contractually, I'm not allowed to give them away, but trading? A loophole covers me there.

Who knows? Just a hunch.
指不定哪儿就会有别人不小心掉的。

Well now I'm here, and the story's the same. Honing my skills with a team custom-built for the gym leader here.
现在我也来这边了，\n当然还是同样的事，\n训练一支专门为馆主准备的队伍。
Though I'm looking forward to it, it'll also be a little bitter-sweet having to take out a fellow enby.
虽然我很期待这次挑战，\n但要打败一个曾经的同窗，\n绝对不是一件简单的事情。
Anyways, I'll be here for now, ready and willing to battle you as much as you want!
总之，我会在这里待一段时间，\n只要你想，随时可以开始训练！
Wanna go?
开一局？
Understood.
明白明白。
I'll be here until you wish to battle.
我会在这里等你回来。
Glorious combat!
为了荣耀！
Ouch. That one hurts. Gotta get used to the pain, though, or else I won't stand a chance against Eko!
诶哟，好疼啊！\n不行，我得习惯疼痛，\n不然怎么可能打赢艾克！
A good fight, really got the blood flowin'.
真是热血沸腾的一战！
Return later for a rematch.
先休息一下，回头再打。
I can tell from the scorch marks that you went up against Eko, and from the gym badge...that you won!
从这些痕迹可以看出...\n你已经跟艾克打过了，\n并且你拿到了道馆的徽章！
That means the time for procrastinating is over, and the time for courage is nigh. Allons-y!
看样子不能再拖延下去了，\n是时候鼓起勇气面对他了。\n势必达成！
Oh, hey. You a trainer?
哦，你好。你是训练家吗？
Listen, I got some Pokémon that need training and… you’re giving me the look like ya heard this before.
我有一些需要训练的宝可梦，但是…\n你给我的表情就像是\n听过很多类似的话了。
Did you run into a young woman, little younger than me, missin' an arm?
你是不是遇过一个\n看起来比我小一点的独臂女孩？
Togekiss with her?
身边带着一只波克基斯？
Well, I do the same thing as her, only I get paid for it.
嗯，我要做的跟她差不太多，\n只不过我有工资拿。
So, uh, care to make this training session a little less boring?
所以，你是否能让这次训练，\n不那么无聊呢?
Ah, no pressure. Just figured a duel might make it a bit more fun.
啊，不要有压力，\n我只是觉得这样开场帅一点。
Ah, just a good ol’ fight.
啊，只是认真打一场而已。
These beasties ain’t anything special – students want their Pokémon to stay in fighting condition, but exams are hell.
这里的学生为了通过考试，\n必须让这些宝可梦们保持战斗状态 - \n即便它们并没有什么特别之处。
That’s where I come in. Wallet a little lighter, mind at ease.
这就是我在做的事情，\n当然，也是有代价的。
Great. Let’s keep these things fighting fit.
太好了，\n让它们保持最佳的战斗状态吧
You down to help me train these?
你愿意帮我训练它们吗？
You ain’t just any two-bit tourist, are you?
你并不是一个普通的游客，对吧？
Tell me: you got a rival? Someone that you keep running into at the worst times? Pushes you to your limit?
或者说 - 你有劲敌吗？\n就是那种总在最糟糕的时候出现，\n将你逼到绝境的人？
Oh, I’ve heard that one before. Family drama. Tale as old as time.
嗯，我听说过这个故事。\n家庭纷争，老生常谈了。
Best of luck with that, I s’pose.
那就祝你好运吧。
Great.
好的。
Ya don’t have to tell me. Not important.
你不用告诉我细节，\n不管他是谁，这不重要。
So long as you’ve got someone – you need somebody.
只要有就好 - 这样就会有动力。
Really? Nobody good enough for ya?
真的？其他人都不配做你的劲敌？
Well, s’pose it don’t matter too much. You’ve done plenty fine without one so far, right?
嗯，倒是也没什么所谓，\n反正你一个人也可以做到这种地步。
Hah!
哈哈！
Nah, kid. I already crossed that bridge, and it’s the kinda road ya don’t walk twice.
算了吧，小家伙。\n我已经走过那条路了，\n绝对不想再走第二次。
'Bout wore me out, too.
那可是很累人的。
You’re good, though, and I’m bein’ genuine.
不过，有一说一，你真的很强。
Ya beat my friend and now ya beat me.
你之前打败了我的朋友，\n现在又打败了我。
Ain’t half-bad. I ain’t paid to gab, though.
好吧 - 可惜没时间闲聊了。
Gotta get movin’ – Trubbish needs training, and the <imp>sewers 'neath LuxTech</imp> are the place to be for it.
我得继续训练破破袋了，\n<imp>光华市的下水道</imp>很适合它。
Here ya go, though, for your troubles.
这是给你的，麻烦你了。
See ya 'round. And, hey, you run into my friend again, beat the tar outta her, alright?
回头再见，哦对了，\n如果你再遇到我那个朋友的话，\n就狠狠地揍她一顿，好吗？

稍等一下
Sure, let's go.

Not right now.
现在先算了
What exactly do you need?
你到底需要什么
Sure thing.
行吧
My brother.
我哥
Someone.
的确
You offering?
要不你来？
[Map57]
I get to go home... doesn’t even seem real yet.
我要回家了…\n这简直太不真实了。
I guess I’m still the gym leader.
我觉得我还是道馆馆主。
Gonna need to find someone else to take the job, eventually. But for now I get to go home.
到头来还是需要找其他人\n来接替这份工作...\n管他的，我终于可以回家了！
And maybe I’m gonna have a talk with Andris and the rest of them, about what happened.
也许我该和安德里斯他们\n好好谈谈发生了什么。
And about sticking me in a cave for a few years to deal with the consequences...
还有把我关在山洞里\n处理了几年烂摊子的事…
Oh, sorry about the wait, I was just preparing to go back on duty.
哦，不好意思久等了，\n我正准备回去值班呢。
I've been investigating a group of thieves.
我在调查一个\n偷进化石的盗贼团伙。
They're hiding out in the \c[2]Kilna Turf\c[0], the route to the east of town.
听说他们逃到\n镇子东边的\c[2]齐纳草径\c[0]了。
The tall grass makes a good hiding place for criminals and their stolen goods.
那些高高的草丛为罪犯和赃物\n提供了绝佳的藏身之处。
If you decide to go over there, you could nab yourself some items which have been forgotten by their owners and those thieves.
也正因为如此，\n那边总会有一些实力一般的训练家，
No need to worry--the trainers there aren't too strong.
抱着碰运气的态度，\n在草丛里寻找小偷遗留的道具。
Have a good one!
不多说了，再见！
[Map58]
[Map59]
A Bicycle. It looks slightly dinged up.
一辆看起来有些旧的自行车。
Young master, before you head out!
少主，稍等一下！
I should have told you this while we were sailing-- your family owns an unused Estate here in Makya.
我路上忘了告诉您 - \n您名下有一处在马凯亚的庄园。
Since you're taking on the Makyan Gym Challenge, I took the initiative to renovate the grounds for our use.
由于之前一直处于弃置状态，\n所以我在听说您要来这边\n进行道馆挑战之后，\n便自作主张将其修缮了一番。
I've set up a system that sends the Pokemon you store in your PC to this <imp>PokÉstate</imp>.
这是我所写的一个程序系统，\n您可以将存储在电脑中的宝可梦\n送到这座<imp>庄园</imp>里休憩。
I'll take care of them there while you are busy with your journey.
当您忙于旅途时，\n我会在那里好好照看它们。
I love Pokemon variety, so I've prepared lots of <imp>EXP Candy</imp> to give you as your collection grows.
随着庄园里的宝可梦种类越来越多，\n我也可以给您提供一些<imp>经验糖果</imp>，\n帮助您完成这次的旅程。
Once you've earned some, I'll send them to you through the PC.
我会将它们寄存在电脑中，\n您可以随时取用。
Would you like to view the PokÉstate? I can take us over there for a visit.
现在要去庄园看看吗？
Understood, I'll wait for you on the boat in the mean time.
是，我会在这里随时恭候。
If you want to visit the PokÉstate, send me a ping at any PC.
如果您想要前往庄园，\n只需要用电脑发消息给我就好。
I'll take you there immediately.
我会立即带您前往那里。
Understood, I'll sail us over.
是，我这就带您前往。
I bought these orbs to spice up my juggling act.
我本来是为了给杂技表演\n增加节目效果才买的这些宝珠。
Ended up burning down a tent, poisoning a clown, and freezing my brother.
然后就烧掉了一顶帐篷，\n毒晕了一个小丑，\n冻住了一个哥们儿。
I'm out of a job. Take pity, and buy 'em off me?
所以我就光荣地失业了，\n能不能把这些东西买下来，\n救济救济我呢？
I'm asking $5,000 for the three of them. Package deal.
一共$5,000怎么样？
I really dropped the ball on this.
这下彻底完蛋了。
My gratitude is immense!
感激不尽！
\PN hands over $5,000 in exchange.
\PN将$5,000交给对方。
Time to travel the countryside to find where they might need a man of my talents.
是时候去乡下转转了，\n看看有哪里需要我这种人才。
You're broke, just like me! Come back when you can help.
同是天涯沦落人啊！\n等你有钱的时候再来吧。
G'day mate. Reckon its a fine day for fishin', yeah?
嘿，今天这天气很适合钓鱼啊！
Been fishing meself a storm lately, gotta ton of new Pokemon to show off.
最近我通过这种运动，\n抓到了不少新宝可梦。
Been rough with this one little bugga though, a Carvanha. Ain't getting along with the others.
不过有个小家伙让我很头疼，\n有只利牙鱼跟其他宝可梦合不来。
Tell ya what, been looking to get into Bug-type collecting for a while now.
这么说吧，\n我最近在找虫属性的宝可梦。
Might as well get started on it, if ya got one spare I'll trade ya for it.
如果你有多余的虫系宝可梦，\n我就用那只利牙鱼跟你交换\n（在箱子里选择宝可梦）。
No worries, mate. I'll be 'ere for a good while if ya change your mind.
不要紧，伙计，\n你要改主意了就再来找我吧。
All good, mate. Show me when ya got one.
好的，伙计，\n你抓到之后再来找我吧。
Right on.
好极了。
Reckon I could get a few more in a couple days.
这几天应该还能再弄几只。
Make a real sick collection of Bug-types, ya?
这样就有超级炫酷的虫系大队了！
Good on ya for catching this 'mon, its a real beauty.
我很喜欢这只宝可梦，\n它真是漂亮极了。
I picked up this bike in Novo Town. The people up there are crazy for bikes, so it was easy to find one.
我之前在望新镇捡了辆自行车，\n那里的人几乎人手一辆，\n所以满大街都是。
For the same reason, though, everyone already got one, so I wasn't able to sell.
但也正因如此，\n根本没有出手的空间。
Seems like the whole job was a bust, so just take it.
这次“捡拾”也太失败了，\n干脆给你算了。
You never saw me, and I didn't cause you any problems. Peace.
你从来没见过我，\n我也不认识你，拜拜。
The berry plant is growing.
树果还在生长中。
It looks excited to take on the next shipment!

These docks may look small, but they're important.
这个码头看起来规模不大，\n但重要性绝对够高。
Every week a shipment comes of groceries and other necessities for Novo Town.
要维持大城市的灯红酒绿，\n就必须得稳定各地的物资支援。
They get some stuff from the big city, but can't rely on it for everything.
每周都会有一批食物和生活必需品，\n在这里装货，运往望新镇。
Mt. Kilna makes it harder to get stuff in between, even with Gigalith's Guts cutting through it.
即便怪岩肠道贯穿了齐纳山，\n也因为受到地形的限制，\n无法进行大规模的陆路运输。
Not right now.
现在不用

I didn’t think there’d be so many people… and you know they’re watching me.
我没想到有这么多人...\n你也看到了他们一直在盯着我。
I hate it out here…

Oh!

You’re a trainer. I was given these to train by – by my friend, so… fight me?
你是个训练家。\n这是...帮我朋友训练的...\n所以...我们打一场吧？
W-well, I – no, I’m a trainer. Face me.
好...好吧...我...\n不对，我也是个训练家，\n所以...面对我吧。
I – I’m not going to let you through until you do.
不然我...我不会让你过去的。
Oh, no, I’m so sorry.
哦，不是，我...抱歉。
Artemisia isn’t – she flies me places.

She doesn’t fight unless I – I’m sorry. I’m talking your ear off.
她不战斗，除非...\n我...抱歉，我不该说这么多。
OK. Good.
好，很好！
I mean, thanks.
我的意思是说...谢谢。

You’re not… nevermind.
你...应该不是...\n算了。
Maybe we’ll meet again – but, uh, I’m – thank you.
或许我们会再见的...\n但是...我...谢谢。
The berry plant is growing.
树果还在生长中。
I'm bored of searching for the <imp>Dragon Den</imp> around here.
我受够了，这里哪有<imp>龙穴</imp>。
Let's battle, instead!
不管了，来跟我打一架吧！
Welp, looks like we're not close to an even match.
唉，看来我们实力差距很大。
You just make sure to keep on truckin' with that team of yours!
你一定要取得更高的成就！
If only I had that Dragon-type...
如果我有那只龙属性就好了……
Looking forward to seeing how you grow!
很期待你将来能达到的高度！

A sharpened mind is the key to victory. Has yours been whetted?
敏锐清晰的头脑是取胜的关键，\n我会让你好好见识一下的。
Yours is a razor's edge. I must hone my own.
你的脑子比我的更好使，\n必须加紧磨练自己了。
Outsmarted and outmatched...for now.
被以智取的方式完胜...\n不过这只是暂时的。
Hey, give me some practice, won't'cha? I'm gonna need it to become one of Eko's gym trainers!
你好，能帮我训练训练吗？\n我还需要积累更多的实战经验，\n才能成为艾克的道馆训练家！
Ouch! Maybe I need to go back and study some more. I don't even have a Poison-type yet!
哎哟！感觉还得继续学习，\n我连只毒属性宝可梦都没有！
See? I didn't do too bad! I could totally work for them!
看见没？我的水平还不错！\n我绝对可以胜任这份工作! 
You got some hot moves! Remind me to introduce you to Lainie -- she'd love ya!
你的那些招式很给力啊！\n我觉得应该把你介绍给兰妮 - \n我想她会喜欢你的！
Hey, good to see you again!
嘿，很高兴再次见到你！
I just created this invention, and I need testers.
我这里又有新的发明，\n现在需要测试人员。
Anyways, I'm traveling up north to the big city for the Battle Festival!
对了，我正打算去北边的大城市，\n参加\c[2]战斗节庆典\c[0]！
Cross the river into <imp>Prizca</imp>, the big city, and I'll be there to give you a 3rd and final invention.
就在河对岸的<imp>宏礼市</imp>，\n也就是大家口中的“大城市”那里，\n到时候我还会给你我的第三个发明。
See ya!
回头见！
The door is locked with an old rusty padlock.
这扇门上锁了一把生锈的锁头。
You press against the door, and the padlock snaps in half!
你稍微用力一推，\n它就分崩离析了！
Maybe if I turn like this he'll catch my good side.
如果我转一下身，\n他或许能捕捉到更好的画面？
Take a hike, we have a portrait to finish!
一边待着去，\n没看到我们正忙着画肖像吗!
I'm searchin' for that bolt of lightning to inspire me. Hit me with it!
我正在寻找那突然的灵光一闪，\n不知道你能不能给我带来灵感！
Ah, I just found the perfect riff! I need to have Lainie listen to this! She'd love it!
我找到完美的旋律了！\n我要赶快去弹给兰妮听听，\n她一定会喜欢的！
Damn! I was feelin' it for a second there, but then it just fell apart.
淦！我刚找到一丢丢灵感，\n结果一下子又全没了！
Serves me right for composing during battle.
这就是在战斗中创作的坏处。
It looks like it's taking a needed rest on the bench.
它看起来需要多休息休息。
Excuse me, I'm posing here.
抱歉，我们正在画肖像！
Don't interfere with the artistic process!
不要干扰艺术创作！
I somehow managed to paint you into the portrait...
不知道为啥就把你画进去了…
It's been a rocky enough job as it is.
难啊...
A splash of brown, then some red...Gotta get the colours on this perfect!
先是棕色打底，然后红色点缀…\n得把这画的颜色完美地呈现出来! 
This job's been a rocky one even without your interference.
就算你没有打扰到我们，\n想要完成这幅画的难度也很大。
You ready? Can we – can we skip the talking and just fight?
 你准备好了吗？\n我们——能不能别废话，\n直接开打? 
No.
不打
A Togekiss?
用波克基斯？
Let's go.
来吧
[Map61]
Ello, landlubber, welcome to the Fin.
你好，旱鸭子，\n欢迎来到鱼鳍港。
You aimin' your sights at the rest of Makya?
你不会还打算\n去马凯亚的其他地方吧？
I were you, I'd take your boat and sail right away. The avatars'll be the end of us, I say.
如果我是你，就立马转身回家！\n毕竟那些化身可不是好对付的。
If you won't stay on the water, at least stay on the paths, ey? They're mostly creepin' in the caves, I heard.
要么坐船走水路，\n要么就挑宽敞的大道走， \n听说那些家伙大多都在山洞里。
[Map62]
Heal Bell would be so nice to have for this gym.
如果带一个治愈铃声就好了。
I did a mistake letting my Skitty forget it.
我竟然犯这种错误。
I'll have to visit the Move Maniac so my Skitty can <imp>relearn</imp> Heal Bell.
我得去找招式教学狂，\n让我的向尾喵<imp>重新学会</imp>这招了。
He's hanging in the Novo PokeCenter.... and in practically every other PokeCenter, somehow.
望新的宝可梦中心应该有吧...\n毕竟在每个宝可梦中心都能见到他们。
At the northernmost part of the Shipping Lane there is a house, and inside of that house a cave, and in that cave an Avatar!
在扬帆路最北端有一座房子，\n房子里面有一个山洞，\n山洞里有一个化身！
Destroy it!
消灭它！
I’ve been waiting years to find a trainer good enough to eradicate it, and you’re the one!
我已经等待多年了，\n等待一个足够强大的训练家，\n而你就是那个人！
This key will get you inside, and then just, well, do what I would do!
这是那里的钥匙，\n然后，照我说的做!
Oh, and be a dear and don’t ask anymore questions. Good luck!
啊，多的别再问了，祝你凯旋！
It waits in the suspicious house in the Shipping Lane! Destroy it, and rid me of the damnable thing for good!
它就在扬帆路那栋可疑的房子里！\n彻底解决那个该死的东西，\n让我脱离苦海吧！ 
Oh? Have you sent the avatar back from whence it came?! Excellent! Your talents are second-to-none!
哦？你已经把那个化身\n送到它该去的地方了？\n好！真是让人放心的实力！
I thought this gym would be a cinch.
我本以为这个道馆会很简单。
A whole team of fish couldn't possibly lose to a Fire- type gym!
毕竟我的鱼鱼队伍\n是不可能输给火系道馆的！
I totally forgot that Poison is strong against Water.
但我忘了现在毒克水！
What, do you miss the lick of flames and bite of acid? Shall we duel once more?
什么，你怀念火焰的舔舐\n和酸液的咬噬了？ \n那就让我们再决斗一场吧！
Congratulations on reaching me!
恭喜你来到我的面前！
And congratulations to all your Pokémon! Especially the ones that are on fire!
也同样恭喜你所有的宝可梦！\n尤其恭喜那些浑身冒火的！
Show us what you’re made of and push through that pain! Just a little longer now!
现在，展示你的实力，坚持下去！\n我觉得你应该知道该怎么做。
Are you ready for the grand finale?
准备好观看压轴大戏了吗？
Go on, then! Take a minute! Get your Pokémon some antidotes, or a fire extinguisher!
当然可以！给足你时间！\n顺便准备好解毒剂和灭火器！
Very well, challenger! I present to you the fullest onslaught I can muster!
很好，挑战者，\n我将向你展示我最猛烈的攻击！
Every other gym leader is a coward, but not I!
其他道馆馆主都是胆小鬼，\n但我不是！
I know that there is only way to test someone: Over! Whelming! PAIN!
我知道考验一个人的方法\n只有一种：极度的痛苦!
Now overcome it, or fall!
现在要么克服它，要么万劫不复！
Lovely! Make no mistake: my panoply of agony takes no half measures.
太好了！另外：\n我可不会手下留情。
I’ll test you with fire and acid, claw and fang!
我会用火焰、酸液、\n利爪以及尖牙来考验你！
Unyielding! Devastating! Indefatigable!
不屈不挠！势不可挡！
Let me tend to the Pokémon while you bask in your victory.
现在你尽请沉浸在胜利的喜悦中吧，\n由我来暂时照顾你的宝可梦。
Not to mention: the Perseverance Badge!
这是你的，毅力徽章！
If you can overcome my gym in such blazing style, I can surely expect great things from you.
如果你能以更炽烈的风格战胜我，\n我肯定可以对你寄予厚望。
Perhaps... there is something we absolutely must talk about!
或许…有些事情我们可以...\n不对，是绝对，必须谈谈！
I’ve got a mission for you, challenger! Something worthy of your skill, I promise.
我有一个任务要给你，\n这绝对是配得上你本事的委托。
Good! Good! Never let that fire within you go out!
很好！很好！\n永远不要让你内心的那团火熄灭!
Your victory was delightfully explosive!
你的胜利真是令人欣喜若狂！
I could use more challengers like you!
真希望能有更多你这样的挑战者！
Wow! I’m feeling the burn – how about you?
哦，我感觉到灼烧感了 - \n你呢，情况怎样？
I’ll get your Pokémon healed.
我会治疗你的宝可梦。
That for them, and this for you: the Perseverance Badge!
这是给它们的，\n也是给你的：毅力徽章！
I yearn for the day I might challenge you again! Either here, or in the Championship!
希望有一天能再次考验你！\n不管是在这里，\n还是在联盟大赛上! 
So long!
再会！
Bruh... this waiting room doesn't have any places to sit down.
唉...这个等候厅里连个座位都没有。
No pain, no gain? Must be what Eko's thinking.
估计这就是艾克的主意，\n让我们在这里体会痛苦。
This is not a lab! It is a gym! In labs we have safety precautions. Here, unsafe conditions are the goal!
这里不是实验室！这是个道馆！\n在实验室里我们得遵守安全准则，\n但在这里，不安全就是我们的准则!
Oh-ho? So you want safe passage? Very well. You've earned the shortcut.
哦？你想安全通过？\n好吧，你赢得了使用捷径的权力。
The wild reaches of Makya won't have safety guidelines. If you can endure this, you can endure them.
马凯亚的野外可没有安全准则可循。\n只要你能忍受这里的考验，\n就能在外界生存下去。
White text flies by on a dark purple background.
白色的文字在紫色的屏幕上\n快速滚动着。
Yo, champ in the making!
嘿，未来的冠军！
Eko is the gym leader here, and they love pain in all its forms.
这个道馆的馆主是艾克，\n他是个热爱各种形式痛苦的训练家，
Therefore they picked Fire and Poison as their specialties.
所以他选择了火系和毒系，\n作为这个道馆的配置。
Ground-types are rather strong in this gym. Psychic-types and Rock-types are none too shabby either.
所以地面系宝可梦的优势最大，\n超能系和岩石系也很不错。
The final piece to this gym's puzzle are the teleporters.
这个道馆里面有一些传送门。
See those blue pads? The ones the trainers are protecting will teleport you past the maze.
看到那些蓝色的地砖了吗？\n踩到它就会将你传送出来。
If you don't unlock them, you'll find yourself walking a harsh path!
如果能够解锁这些传送门，\n会对你的挑战提供很多帮助。
'Grats on beating the gym!
恭喜你通过了道馆挑战！
You pushed through the pain just fine.
你成功克制了自己的痛苦。
Sorry for blocking the way, but I'm desperately dehydrated.
抱歉，我挡了你的路，\n但我已经有些脱水了。
You have a <imp>Fresh Water</imp>! I'll be taking that...
你有一瓶<imp>美味之水</imp>！\n我想要的就是这个...
The man takes a Fresh Water from your bag.
他以迅雷不及掩耳之势，\n从你的包里拿走了一瓶美味之水。
Ahhhh.... that helps a lot. Thanks.
啊...得救了，万分感谢。
Consider the lockdown over.
我这就让开这条路。
The scientists keep offering me liquids in beakers, but I've had too many close calls with caustic chemicals to just trust 'em on the contents.
这里的科学家们只用烧杯\n提供给我一些奇奇怪怪的液体喝，\n但我见过他们做实验的样子，\n实在是不敢下口。
I can't leave my post, so blocking the gym entrance is my only leverage.
但我又不能随便离开岗位，\n所以只能用这种方法寻求生命之源。
I'm plopping down here until a challenger like yourself grabs me a <imp>Fresh Water</imp>.
我只能等在这里，期盼着那些...\n训练家带来的<imp>美味之水</imp>。
There's a couple <imp>vending machines</imp> scattered around Novo Town, so it should be easy to find a bottle.
望新镇附近有几台<imp>自动售货机</imp>，\n应该不难获得。
I hope you won't find this cruel. The suffering I'm about to inflict is strictly necessary.
我希望你不会觉得这残忍，\n因为这些是必须承受之痛。
...Noted. Please avail yourself of this teleporter. Taking the long way may subject any afflicted Pokemon to undue injury.
...好的，你可以使用传送门了。\n绕远路会对受伤的宝可梦\n造成持续的二次伤害。
Thank you for your participation. Step carefully, now! Wouldn't want any lingering side effects... heh.
感谢您的参与，但现在请小心行事，\n只要你不想留下后遗症...呵呵。

Our glorious Champion! Good evening!
晚上好，我们的冠军！
Or morning! I’m not in the business of keeping count of the hours. That’s for the interns!
还是说早上好？\n无所谓，我不负责计时工作，\n那是实习生该干的事！
Now, why are you here? Hoping for a rematch? Looking to learn more about me?
那你来这里做什么？\n希望再来一场重赛？\n还是说想更多的了解我？
Sorry! I’m busy! Drastically, obscenely busy! There is much work to be done, and I absolutely cannot spoil what it might be!
但是很抱歉，我现在很忙！\n忙得要命，忙得头疼！\n我现在有太多的工作需要做了！
Goodbye, \PN. We’ve already had our last battle.
再见，\PN。\n我们的最后一战已经结束了。
Not yet.

The Aether Foundation, from Alola, is looking to establish a branch in Makya.
来自阿罗拉的以太基金会，\n正打算在马凯亚建立分部。
I'm here to do some location research for that, but I also have a secret project of my own.
所以就派我来进行选址调查了，\n当然我也有自己的秘密项目。
To help me along, think you'd like to buy this Alolan Meowth?
如果想要帮助我，\n你愿意买下这只阿罗拉喵喵吗？
For a low, low price of $5000, you could help me along.
只要$5000的低价，\n你就可以得到它了。
Sure, I'm certain another Alolan Meowth will just stumble into your hands.
好吧，不过我相信，\n你总能得到一只来自阿罗拉的喵喵。
Why thank you, stranger. Rest well knowing that you are a patron of science.
谢谢你，陌生人。\n感谢你对科学的赞助。
\PN hands over $5000 in exchange.
\PN交出$5000作为交换。
Well, not gonna waste any more time here. I've got science to do.
有经费了就不能再浪费时间，\n该去进行我的科学研究了。

嗯？其他支付方式？\n你没有现金吗？
No thanks.
不买
Sure, I'll pay.
买了
[Map66]
Wow! Well done! That must have been nervewracking.
好好好！这可真不容易。
I wonder why those two Pokemon came here in the first place.
不过问题是那两只宝可梦\n为什么会出现在这种地方？
Aren't Absol drawn to areas with upcoming disasters?
阿勃梭鲁不是只有\n在通知灾难时才会现身吗？
Yikes. I hope they predicted wrong.
哎呀。我希望它们预测错了。
Anyways, thanks for all the help.
不管怎样，谢谢你的帮助。
I'm gonna get out of this place, it's got to be packed with bad vibes.
我得赶紧离开这个地方，\n以免真的发生什么不好的事。
Oh, man, perfect timing!
诶哟，来得正是时候!
I came up here to investigate a noise complaint.
我是在接到投诉之后，\n来这里检查噪音来源的工作人员。
Turns out there's this freaking ghost spirit thing running around!
发现有一个该死的幽灵在到处乱跑！
Then out of nowhere an Absol busts into the room and they start staring each other down!
然后有只来历不明的阿勃梭鲁\n突然闯进了这个房间，\n它们就这样互相盯着对方看！
I'm too afraid to get close, and I'm too afraid to leave them alone.
我不敢靠近，也不敢离开。
Could you, ya know, deal with it?
你...你能处理一下吗?
Well don't look at me, I left my Pokemon at home!
别看我，\n我把宝可梦留在家里了！
Absol is silently staring at the spirit.
阿勃梭鲁默默地盯着对方。
It has a tense expression, but it's shaking slightly.
它的表情很紧张，\n身体在微微颤抖。
The Absol looks at you, expression blank, but trembling.
阿勃梭鲁看着你，\n神色茫然、颤抖不已。
If you tried to catch it, it probably wouldn't put up a fight.
或许这正是抓住它的好机会。
You'll leave the Pokemon here for now.
你暂时将宝可梦留在这里。
You bring out a Pokéball from your bag while petting the Absol on its head.
你从包里拿出一个精灵球，\n同时抚摸着阿勃梭鲁的头。
You swear you see the faintest smile form on it before it enters the ball.
在它进球之前，\n你看到它嘴边浮现出\n一丝微不可见的弧度。
You don't have a Pokeball to give it.
你没有精灵球可以装它。
No
不抓
Yes
抓了
[Map67]
I was so excited by the idea of moving to a smaller town, away from the hustle and bustle of Prizca.
一想到要搬到一个小城镇，\n远离喧嚣浮躁的宏礼市，\n我就很兴奋。
Away from my parents, too.
还能远离我的父母。
The privacy, the freedom, the agency, it's all been great.
有隐私、有自由、能自决，\n这一切都那么美好。
It's just...
只是...
I can't get used to how quiet it is all the time.
一直这么安静反而有些不习惯。
[Map68]
I'm participating in the current archival project at the Digsite Ruins.
我正在参与一项遗址发掘项目。
Those ginormous statues won't document themselves, so we have to!
那些巨型雕像缺少文字记录，\n所以只能靠我们猜着写！
I wrote a whole paper on the special significance of where each Regi was placed in the main chamber.
我上一篇论文全部篇幅都在介绍\n每位巨人都代表着什么意义。
I spy a MasterDex!
你有大师图鉴！
Yours truly submitted lots of information for that project.
看样子你收集了很多信息。
Collecting information on this here Boldore was especially difficult.
对于拥有一只地幔岩的我来说，\n想要收集这些并不容易。
She just loved phasing my carefully collected notes out of existence!
她有时候会把我的文件弄坏！
[Map69]
[Map70]
I always thought of myself as quite dedicated, but my roommate blows me out of the water.
我一直认为自己是死忠粉，\n但我的室友让我开了个大眼。
I've gotta scrounge up some more Eevee Tickets and visit that pub in Prizca East.
我还得再搞几张伊布票，\n然后去东宏礼市的酒吧。
Then, I'll be able to call myself a true fan!
这样就能算是合格的死忠粉了吧！

I gained a lot of weight living on my own, with no parents to stop me from binging ice cream.
一个人生活的时候，\n就没有父母来阻止我狂炫冰淇淋了，\n所以体重增加了很多。
I started swimming to try and get in shape. I even went ocean swimming!
为了保持身材，我开始游泳，\n从池塘到河流，再到大海！
Soon after, though, this accursed Pokemon started following me around! It won't leave me alone!
然后就被这只可恶的宝可梦盯上了，\n一直纠缠不休！
All it does is poke my stomach over and over while smirking! It makes me feel really self conscious.
它总是一边傻笑一边戳我肚子！\n这让我感到很不自在。
I want a NICE Pokemon! One that I can go for runs with and one that doesn't make me feel awful all the the time!
我想要一只友善的宝可梦！\n一个可以和我一起运动，\n不会让我一直感到难受的宝可梦!

Please, if you have one, I will trade you for it.

请不要拿我开玩笑，\n这只会让我更痛苦。
Thank you, you've done me a huge favor.

正在播放一档运动节目，\n飞腿郎、快拳郎和战舞郎\n正在进行同步表演。
No
不换

I was attacked by an avatar a few weeks ago.
一个月前我被化身攻击了。
You'd think that I'd know how to battle since my parents were Chasm, but no.
虽说我的父母都是裂隙队成员，\n但我对对战一窍不通。
I was caught with my pants down.
所以就只能屁滚尿流地逃走了。
I only met my roommate recently.
我最近才认识我的室友。
Apparently both of her parents... Were in Team Chasm?
听说她的父母都是...\n裂隙队成员？
I guess I shouldn't judge. I hear some professors still hold a grudge, though.
我知道不应该随意评判这些，\n不过我听说有些博士仍怀恨在心。
Their fight with Team Chasm ended like a decade ago, right? Why keep the bad blood?
一方面，他们和裂隙队的斗争\n十年前就已经结束了，\n为什么还要彼此仇视呢？
But on the other hand, if somebody sicced a Salamence on my school, I'd be pissed.
但从另一方面来说，\n如果有人派一只暴飞龙\n攻击我们的学校，\n我也会很生气。
[Map73]
I've been working with the local Pokemon Center in order to improve the healing stations.
为了改善治疗装置，\n我一直在与当地的宝可梦中心合作。
The college gave me a decent grant in order to do so. I'm trying to make the thing more energy efficient.

Hopefully this research will let us set up centers in even more places.

[Map74]
Fed up with doing nothing -- Out hunting Avatars.
厌倦了无聊的生活 - \n外出狩猎化身。
[Map75]
I recently transferred here from Sinnoh.
我是一名研究幽灵系宝可梦\n行为的研究生。
I am a graduate student that studies the behaviors of Ghost-type Pokemon.
刚从神奥调到这边不久。
You might be able to tell from the furnishing, but I do like this sort of haunted mansion aesthetic.
你也许能从家具上看出来，\n我喜欢那种闹鬼大宅的装饰风格。
It also puts my Pokemon at ease.
这种风格也能让我的宝可梦住得舒服。
[Map76]
What are you doing?
你是什么人？
Get the hell out of my room!
滚出我的房间！
Give me a second to compose myself. I'd like to give an apology if you talk to me later.
让我稍微冷静一下。\n你吓了我一大跳。
Ok. Sorry. I'm calmer now. That was really rude of me to do that.
差不多了，抱歉。\n我现在冷静多了。\n我那样做真是太无礼了。
Just get out of here! Leave, ok?
快离开这里吧，伙计！\n离开，好吗？
Hey, I was rude earlier. I was just in the moment and I don't like distractions.

Oh, you've never heard of them?
啊，你没听说过他们？
Zoé is the rock-tough Gym Leader of Prizca West, and Bence is a loser weakling trying to take her spot.
佐伊是宏礼市西区的道馆馆主，\n而本斯是一个充满嫉妒心，\n妄图取代她位置的可怜弱鸡。
You'd think the government would do something, but the Gymnasium Office has cowardly ignored all my emails.
我为此给政府部门写了好几封邮件，\n但道馆管理办公室却无视了我。
You got the Prizca West badge, that means... you beat Zoe?!
你拿到了西宏礼道馆的徽章，\n也就是…你打败了佐伊？
You must be some trainer. I've still got a ways to go before I can even approach her level.
你一定是位出色的训练家。\n要达到她的水平，\n我还有很长的路要走。
...tell me you wallopped Bence, too, right?
...你也痛扁了本斯一顿，对吧？
[Map77]
I hope I get to go spelunking for my Paleontology courses.
我希望能去参加古生物学老师\n组织的洞穴探险活动。
Makya has such grand caves, after all. It'd be a shame to not get to see them.
毕竟马凯亚有太多壮观的洞穴，\n错过可就太可惜了。
There's one with a bunch of petrified Pokemon. And one where water flows in intricate patterns.

可恶的搬家...可恶的家务活...
Ugh.
啊，让我死了算了。

The Kadabra is focusing very hard.
这只勇基拉正在集中精力。
Many of the species researched here are are hard to find in the wild.

Because of this, they offer jobs for trainers to bring in the Pokemon needed for new studies.

Finding data is one thing, but interpretation is a whole different beast.

Interpretation isn't as clear cut as just collecting more data.
分析数据也是很消耗脑力的。
Which is why I've been stuck here doing statistics calculations for hours...
这就是我被统计表\n困在这里好几个小时的原因...

So, take this. It's not of any use to me anymore.
所以，把这个拿走吧，\n我已经用不到了。
Huh? Whuh? Uh?
嗯？嗯！呃...
Oh, hey. Uh. Yeah. Secure the funding.... zzz...
哦...那个...说得对！zzz...
A slide is being shown with a graph projecting profits for the next year.

Well, before you get all judgemental on me, know that it's because the lights here are way too bright, and they give me headaches.
作为一个女孩子，\n只要能挡住那刺眼的灯光，\n长不长个对我来说已经不重要了。

Keeping inventory here is tough work.
管理仓库这项工作非常艰巨。

训练家和研究员们来拿东西，\n经常不打招呼不做报告。
As a result, we often just lose things. Stranger still, sometimes we just GAIN things.
所以经常会出现\n一些物品突然消失的情况，\n但最奇怪的是，\n有时候还会莫名多出一些东西。
Like this TM, which no one's bothered to claim.

Aren't computers rad? With enough work, it seems like they can do anything!
电脑真是个好东西，\n只要用心研究，\n它几乎无所不能！
Of course, learning how to make them do what we want is the hard part...
当然，对于新手来说，\n学会如何用电脑是最难的部分...

光华所有项目的\n后勤和资金都归她管。

We're here on correspondence about LuxTech's sponsorship of the upcoming League Tournament.
我们这次来这里，\n打算询问一些关于\n光华市对联盟大会的资助信息。

Some even gave me free stuff.
甚至还有人送给我一些小礼物。

有好消息了？\n很好，把货物给我吧。
You give the shipment to Helena.
你把货物交给海伦娜。
This sets us a few days ahead of schedule -- well, ahead of the adjusted schedule.
这可以让我们的计划\n在货物出现问题后，\n依然能在原定时间内完成。
Regardless, I will uphold my end of this transaction.
放心，我说到做到。
Meet me in my gym when you’re ready. And do try and be prompt.
准备好就来道馆找我吧，\n尽量准时到。
No, I don’t have anything better to do than wait here for someone to get my shipment back from wherever in the caves it ended up.
我没有别的事情可做？\n没办法，最重要的货物还在山洞里呢。

我的勇基拉就学了好几种编程语言。
He's the perfect "Rubber Ducklett", catching mistakes as soon as I type them!
他就是最完美的“纠错人”，\n每次我输入错误他都会立即发现！
Hey, are you \PN? Mavis’s child?
哦，你是 \PN？\n梅维斯的孩子？
I haven’t seen you since you were Munchlax-sized.
上次见你的时候，\n也就跟小卡比兽差不多大吧。
Oh, excuse me, were you registering for a challenge?
啊，抱歉，你要预约挑战？
We’re processing all the latecomers trying to get into the Championships, plus logistics for the event itself, so -- actually.
我们正在处理一些\n关于竞技大会参加者的事务，\n以及相关比赛的后勤工作，\n所以...现在...
You’re chasing Zain, I presume?
你是在追赶赞恩？
Of course. I lost to him, oh, a week and a half ago?
没错，我输给他了，\n大概在十天之前？
I understand that rivalry -- and I understand you don’t have a few weeks to spare.
我知道你们的竞争关系，\n也理解你赶时间的想法。
Just like I don’t have time to wait for a particularly late shipment to arrive.
就像我工作时也没时间等待\n那些运送得特别慢的货物一样。
Normally I’d praise you for playing your cards close to your chest, but not with me.
如果是平时，\n我会夸你能隐藏自己的想法，\n但现在还是开门见山的好。
Don’t play coy -- I’m smarter than that. I’m cutting you a deal, so be smart and listen.
我不傻，知道你们的事情。\n现在我是要跟你做一笔交易，\n所以不用做多余的掩饰了。
...Fine. I don’t believe you, but I’ve been wrong before.
...好吧，说实话我不信，\n但我以前也判断错过。
Rarely.
虽然极少。
In any case, you’re not the patient sort, and if Tamarind is to be believed you have a knack for dangerous errands.
总之，你不像个很有耐心的人，\n如果塔玛琳说的没错，\n你应该很擅长执行一些危险任务。
I need a shipment located.
我需要找到一批货物。
There’s a tunnel we call Gigalith’s Guts to the southwest. It links the Kilna Turf to the County Park.
西南边有一条我们称之为\n怪岩肠道的隧道，\n它连通了齐纳草径和国立公园。
You can imagine how convenient that little shortcut is for shipping, and hence why a hypothetical important set of objects would be routed through it.
你应该能想象得到这条路\n对于货物运输来说有多么便捷，\n所以有些重要的货物\n会通过那里进行运送。
Those objects are late, and now I’m hearing that the Guts are clogged with avatars.
但那批货物现在还没送达，\n据说是因为怪岩肠道被化身占领了。
Wh-what? You already have the shipment?
什、什么？\n那些货物就在你手上？
I’m not going to ask why you have this.
好吧，我不会多问的。
Well. No matter.
看样子，既然问题解决了。
Um, I suppose I have to accept the challenge now.
我无论如何都要接受挑战了。
Let’s capitalize on this inexplicable lack of delays and have a quick battle, yes?
那就趁这个空挡尽快结束，如何？
To be explicit: save me time and get me my shipment, and I’ll save you time and put on my gym leader hat for a challenge.
简单来讲：\n你如果帮我节省拿到货物的时间，\n我就帮你节省道馆挑战的时间。
LuxTech's main business is in Technical Machines, so naturally we have a ton of programmers and computer scientists.
光华科技的主要业务是器械制造，\n所以我们有大量的程序员\n和计算机领域的人才。
However, LuxTech spends a decent amount on research as well, so there's scientists everywhere too.
不过光华在其他研究上\n也投入了不少资金，\n所以到处都能看见研究员。
On top of that, we employ former pro-trainers to test our new products.
我们还聘请了一些前职业训练家，\n帮助我们对新产品进行测试。
Speaking of which, take this. I was told to give it to Trainers who talked to me.
说到这里，收下这个吧。\n上级说如果有训练家来跟我聊天，\n就把这个给他。
The diversity here is wonderful.

You've beaten everyone, so as promised, a reward.

With all the work Helena's putting in, she deserves to have a good sport like you as victor.
海伦娜付出了那么多努力，\n也该遇到像你这样强大的训练家了。
Ah, so you've made it to me. However, it looks like some of my teammember's here remain unchallenged.
啊，你终于来找我了。\n不过，你还没有完成我们的挑战。
Go back and fight them all, then come back to me.
去挑战大家吧，\n然后再来找我。
I have no more to offer you, I'm afraid. Your battling data was excellent, so it's a shame.
恐怕我拿不出什么奖品了，\n你的战斗数据非常优秀，\n所以很遗憾。
It looks relieved to no longer be floating!
看起来它很高兴能重新回到地面上！
One of the scientists here gave me a batch of weird rocks, and told me to give some to my Mudsdale.
有个研究员给了我一批奇怪的石头，\n她让我把其中一部分\n给我的重泥挽马带上。
I now understand why she said "some" instead of "all".
我现在明白她为什么说的是\n“一部分”而不是“全部”了，\n我的宝可梦现在飘在半空，\n根本没办法下来。
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do except wait until the effect wears off.
我不知道我该怎么办了，\n只能在这里等它效果消失。
Here, I have one more. You should take it, I've done enough damage as it is.
给，就是一颗这样的石头，\n你拿走吧，我已经受够了。
I hope someone comes along soon. Me and my Pokemon are starting to get hungry.
赶紧来人帮忙啊，\n我和我的宝可梦都饿了。

Crisis averted!
危机解除了！
You aced that test, Swadloon!

Participate in battles against our scientists, and you may earn a hi-tech prize.

I'm a berry farmer now, but I used to be Team Chasm. One of the good ol' grunts.
我是一个普普通通的果农。
That's all behind me now, but I've been feeling nostalgic.
以前我也曾为裂隙队工作过，\n虽然那些都已经过去了，\n但最近我一直很怀念以前的日子。
I've been looking at old photos of my team. I looked snazzy in the Chasm uniform.
我一直在翻看以前的旧照片，\n当年穿制服的我真的很帅！
My Pokemon were all adorable.
手下的宝可梦们也很可爱。
Wouldn't it be nice to see 'em all again like they were...
要是能再见到它们，\n看看它们的样子…\n那该多好啊…
Actually, tell you what, if you round up my old team and bring 'em here for me to look at, I'll let you have some of my harvest out back.
要不，我们这样吧，\n如果你能凑齐我之前的队伍，\n让我看一眼，\n我就让你到果园里收一些树果。
Sound good? I'm not askin' to take 'em, just lookin'.
听起来不错吧？\n我并不是想要它们，\n只是看一眼而已。
A Bergmite, a Nosepass, a Lunatone, a Solrock, and an Elekid. Bring me these five and it'll make my year.
分别是冰宝、朝北鼻、月石、\n太阳岩和电击怪。\n再次同时看到这五种宝可梦，\n也算是我的一个心愿了。

冰宝、朝北鼻、月石、\n太阳岩和电击怪，\n你都带来了吗？
Amazing, there they all are!
太棒了，它们都在！
Feel free to pluck the berries directly off of those trees.
不用对后院里的果子客气，\n想摘多少摘多少。
I see that you don't. No problem, I've got things I can do while waiting.
你没有去摘果子？\n没事，我可以等你一会儿。
What a wonderful feeling this is.
这感觉真是太美妙了。
Lives move on, but it's good to remember sometimes.
生活积极向前，\n往事也分外美好。
A Pokemon Contest Spectacular is being shown on TV.
电视上播的是宝可梦大赛实况。
The audience is watching in awe as a Galvantula weaves an electrified web in the shape of a Pikachu.
其中一方的电蜘蛛，\n竟然编织出了一张\n皮卡丘形状的电网。

Ah, hello. A trainer, I take it?
啊，你好。\n你是一名训练家吧?
And a foreigner as well. Don’t ask me how I can tell – it’s plain enough. Well, we’re alike in that.
而且你还是外国人。\n不要问我怎么看出来的，\n很明显，而且我也是“老外”。
Tell me, have you found any Makyan regional forms yet?
你见过马凯亚特有的\n宝可梦地区形态吗？
I hadn’t realized they were so poorly-known.
它们知名度这么低？
Every region has its own unique environmental pressures. In the most extreme cases, these lead to radically different subspecies of Pokémon.
因为每个地区环境不同，\n会使部分宝可梦在极端条件下，\n产生与正常形态截然不同的亚种。
Makya is home to its fair share.
马凯亚地区也有一些这样的宝可梦。
How unfortunate. I hear Makyan Sentrets have been a favorite of trainers seeking to challenge Eko.
真可惜，听说马凯亚地区的尾立，\n已经进化成那些想要挑战艾克的\n训练家们的最爱。
Perhaps you could benefit from one?
对你来说应该也是不错的选择。
Good. I can imagine they’d be invaluable to a trainer.
很好，对训练家来说，\n每一种新的宝可梦都是无价的。
More options is rarely a downside, now is it?
多一种选择永远都不是坏处。
Indeed? Perhaps when I am less busy I’ll collect data from trainers who have witnessed these creatures in battle personally.
真的？哪天等我没那么忙，\n我想亲自收集一下它们的战斗数据。
But manners elude me, apparently.
抱歉，忘了自我介绍。
I am <imp>Keoni</imp>, from Alola.
我是来自阿罗拉地区的<imp>奇奥妮</imp>。
I study form changes in Pokémon, with a focus on regional forms.
我正在研究宝可梦的形态变化，\n其中的重点就是地区形态的研究。
I’m not exactly a Professor, but I like to think I’ve provided the world with some works of value.
准确来说，我还算不上“博士”，\n但也的确为这个世界\n做出了一些力所能及的贡献。
Would you assist me in gathering some data? You’re a trainer, after all.
你能帮我收集一些数据吗？\n毕竟你是一位训练家。
I recently caught this peculiar Sentret. Perhaps we could battle?
我最近捉到了一只当地的尾立，\n要不来一场宝可梦对战？
Well, I wouldn’t want to impose on you. I’m sure you’re very busy.
好吧，你或许很忙，\n我不会强求你的。
Very good. I’ll be taking notes, if you don’t mind.
很好，你如果不介意，\n我会把这场对战记录下来。
Would you agree to a quick battle, then?
要来一场快速对决吗？
Well fought.
打得好！
It certainly is a peculiar creature, isn’t it? That eye-like structure isn’t a sensory organ – at least not in the traditional sense.
这种生命的确很神奇对吧？\n那个像眼睛一样的结构\n不是传统意义上的视觉器官。
It projects psychic force and enables some kind of limited telepathy.
它可以将精神力量投射到现实，\n并实现某种程度上的心灵感应。
What pressures could cause such an adaptation…? Perhaps some manner of Fighting-type predator?
是什么样的环境压力才促使\n它们产生了这种适应性呢...？\n也许是某种格斗属性的捕食者?
Ah, but forgive me for wasting your time.
啊，不好意思浪费你时间了。
Here, take these. Perhaps you’ll do some field research of your own, eh?
给，拿着这些吧，\n这样你自己也能进行实地调查了。
I’ve heard of a pair of Makyan Pokémon on the <imp>banks of the Eleig River</imp>.
我听说在<imp>埃利格河附近</imp>\n还有一些马凯亚特有的地区形态。
Perhaps I’ll find some answers there…
或许我应该去那儿找找答案…
Makyan forms?
马凯亚形态？
Not yet.
还没
I have.
我抓到了
And fought with them.
我正在训练它们

My Pokemon is mad at me for being such a couch potato.
我的宝可梦跟我闹矛盾了，\n因为我总是长在沙发里。
It should probably be out in the world rather than stuck here with me.
它的确应该去外面多逛逛，\n而不是跟我一样懒散。
Hmm... maybe it's time to find a Ghost-type Pokemon.
嗯...或许找一只幽灵属性的\n宝可梦会合适一些。
Then I won't have to worry about getting it sunlight.
这样我就不用整天\n带它出去晒太阳了。
If you happen to have one, I'll trade you my Applin for it.
如果你碰巧有，\n我会用啃果虫和你交换\n（在箱子里选择宝可梦）。
Fair enough. Maybe I can teach it to enjoy relaxation for once.

Ah, you got its hopes up. Mean.

OK, stick with me on this one: y'know Helena? She's, what, in her forties?
嘿，你听我说：\n你认识海伦娜吗？\n她大概四十多岁对吧?
So that means she was in her thirties when she was some Team Chasm bigshot. What'd she do before that?

我是城都相扑大会的超级粉丝。

Which means I have to get rid of this Snubbull. I just don't have the energy to deal with its antics.

If this thing does nothing but stare at me all day, that's a plus.
如果工作时间它不打扰我，\n那就更好了。
The Pokemon you gave me is nice. It cleans up after itself and it's a great conversation partner.
你给我的宝可梦很不错，\n它会自己清理卫生，\n还是个非常好的伙伴。
I get to just bloviate, and it will listen.
不管我说什么废话，\n它都会在旁边听着。

I'm a tourist from Alola!
我是来自阿罗拉的游客！
My favorite Pokemon can be found in this region, but I haven't had luck in getting one.
这个地区有我最喜欢的宝可梦，\n但是我一直都找不到。
If you have a Chingling, I'm willing to trade my Grimer for it.
如果你有铃铛响，\n我愿意拿我的臭泥换它。
It's a Dark-type, since it came from Alola.
因为它来自阿罗拉，\n所以是恶属性的\n（在箱子里选择宝可梦）。
Dang, guess I'll have to keep looking.
那我只得继续找了。
Ah, you had me excited there for a moment.
啊，你让我白高兴一场。
A Chingling! Alright, let's get started!
是铃铛响！\n那好，我们开始交换吧！
Wow, it's so adorable!

In order to fight the climate, you have to keep you and your Pokemon in tip-top shape.
为了抵御恶劣的天气，\n你得让宝可梦时刻处于最佳状态。
Both physically and mentally. Out there, your body and your mind are under attack.
在外面，无论是身体，\n还是心灵都会受到挑战和压力。
Having one crack will lead to the other cracking just as fast.
一旦出现了一个问题，\n那么其他问题也会接踵而至。
Take this.
拿上它吧。
Use it if it helps, but the most important part is that a perfect body needs a perfect mind.
或许你能用得上，但最重要的是，\n要靠健康的思想保护我们的身体。
If you ever get tired of battling and want a change of pace, we're always looking for new recruits.
如果你厌倦了战斗，\n想换一种生活节奏，\n那我们随时欢迎你的加入。
We're doing operations all over the region, so you'll get to see everything Makya has to offer.
我们在这个地区四处执行任务，\n所以能见识到马凯亚每一处的风光。
I help coordinate rescue operations with some of the Makyan rangers.
我和马凯亚的义军一起工作，\n负责组织和协调救援任务。
We used to just work around the Ice Cave area, but now we've been funded by LuxTech to start holding operations for the entire region.
我们以前只活跃在冰之洞窟附近，\n但自从得到光华的资助，\n我们的业务便逐步扩展到了整个地区。
It's been tough.
太难了！
Strange Pokemon have been appearing out of nowhere.
最近突然冒出来了\n好多奇怪的宝可梦。
A lot of Mayka's caverns have been deemed unsafe for travel.
现在马凯亚的很多洞穴\n都不再适合旅行和探险了。
We manage, but if people would stop being so reckless, that would also help a ton.
目前我们还能勉强应付，\n但如果人们不再那么冒失行事，\n我们的工作压力就会小很多。
The mountains here are dangerous.
这边的山里非常危险。
Winding tunnels, dead ends, and circular paths make it a labyrinth even for experienced hikers.
净是些蜿蜒曲折的隧道、\n和走到尽头才能发现的死胡同，\n就算是经验丰富的徒步旅行者，\n也是十分棘手的挑战。
Now all of a sudden with avatar Pokemon on the loose, it's made the situation even worse.
现在突然出现的化身宝可梦，\n更是让其难度倍增。
People are getting attacked left and right, and the number of Trainers capable of killing one are pretty low.
人们四处遭遇袭击，\n而有实力除掉化身的训练家寥寥无几。
Hopefully we can train some more capable battlers in the near future.
希望在不久的将来能培养出\n更多更强的训练家。
The computer glows faintly. A list of documents are organized into various folders.

我感觉每过十五秒\n都会出现一只新的化身。
Those kids living there are so lucky that, like, two capable Trainers live there.
住在那里的孩子们运气真好，\n身边有两位强大的训练家。
I don't know what's with that spot. It has to be cursed or something.
真搞不懂那个地方到底咋回事，\n是被诅咒了还是什么？
Daily patrols are required. Nothing too bad has happened yet, but it could get much worse.
我们每天每时每刻都得巡逻，\n虽然目前还没发生什么严重的事情，\n但情况可能会变得更糟。
I swear I've been there like four times in three days. I don't even have the patience to write a proper report.
我这三天已经去巡逻了四次，\n连正式报告都没心情写了。
Well, peace or something. Dunno how to end this.
好吧，只能祝愿和平啥的...
Multiple avatars have been reported in the sewers.
下水道里出现了多个化身。
While in other situations we might send some Rangers in, it's actually much easier to simply leave them to their business.
在正常情况下，\n我们或许会派义军过去处理，\n但现在最好的办法\n是让它们彼此互相解决。
There are only a few exits, which are staffed by sewer treatment personnel. Each of them are registered trainers.
毕竟下水道只有几个出口，\n都由污水处理人员看守，\n而且每个工作人员都是训练家。
The walls down there are hard to dig through, and Trainers rarely travel through there.
地下的墙壁很难挖掘，\n再者说能力足够的训练家太少。
It's more efficient to leave the avatars down there until we have more Rangers available.
目前义军仍然人手短缺，\n所以打算等有空了再一并处理。
Witnesses observed multiple avatars destroy the bridge that connects Prizca to southern Makya.
有目击者看到几个化身破坏了\n连接宏礼市和南马凯亚的桥梁。
This has caused a large disturbance for intra- regional shipping.
这对那片区域的通行\n造成了很大影响。
The situation isn't dire, but shipping to Novo Town and the LuxTech Campus has been limited to air travel.
虽然情况还不算很糟，\n但运往望新镇和光华市的货物\n只能靠航空运输了。
The avatar of Terrakion remains on the Prizca side of the bridge crossing.
代拉基翁的化身还留在\n宏礼市方向的桥头上。
Gigalith's Guts has been a hot spot of avatar activity.
怪岩肠道一直是\n化身活跃的重灾区。
Particularly strong avatars have been spotted both on the mountain and within it.
无论是在山上还是洞里，\n都出现了一些实力强大的家伙。

Non-Trainers are advised to avoid the area entirely.

从来到这里之后，\n阿凡的抱怨就没停过。

Rangers patrolling Grouz have observed strange sightings of a potential four-legged avatar.
在古治镇巡逻的义军\n发现了一个四条腿的奇怪化身。
While previous patrols have confirmed the existence of avatar activity in the area, this particular sighting is rather unique.
的确当地的确早就有\n其他化身活动的痕迹，\n但这次发现的化身格外不同。
Every avatar sighted in the area has been confirmed as Steel-type, and all known four-legged Steel-type Pokemon are too slow to match observed movement.
此次出现的化身不仅速度极快，\n与之前的其他四足化身不同，\n也并非当地常见的钢属性。
A local living in the area has reported multiple strange sightings in the surrounding area.
当地的居民报告称，\n曾多次在周围看到奇怪的景象。
The proximity of his home to Gigalith's Guts makes his case plausible, but his reports don't seem to match the avatars known to be in the area.
目击位置与怪岩肠道很近，\n使得此次报告的可信度提高，\n但他对化身的描述却并不寻常。
Notably, he has also reported sighting two different Pokemon. The sighting locations and timings from other reports corroborate his story.
根据 现场的破坏迹象，\n可以推出是由一只强大的化身所为。
The destruction left at the sites of each sighting suggest an incredibly powerful avatar.
但目击者却声称看到了\n两只种类完全不同的宝可梦。
Rangers looking to confirm these reports are advised to be in parties of no smaller than two.

TV here is so dull.
这里的电视也忒无聊了。
Nothin' but trashy dramas and fretting about avatars.
除了烂俗的肥皂剧\n和对化身的瞎操心以外，\n没有半分钱看头。
I wish I brought my laptop.

The Alolan Rattata seems to really appreciate that you saved it.
阿罗拉小拉达\n似乎很感激你救了它。
It must have been left here by its owner and then chased by the avatar of Arbok.

It seems like it wants you to catch it.

Occasionally a Pokemon will fail out of our cold survival training course.
但是有些时候，我们会收到一些\n无法适应这里工作的宝可梦。
This Sewaddle didn't make it through.
这只虫宝包显然就是其中之一，\n它根本不会制冷。
I need a Pokemon that'll definitely fill the slot.
我需要一只能制造冰块\n或者能使周围降温的宝可梦。 
Pretty much any Ice-type should do. If you have one, I'll trade you for it.
基本所有冰系宝可梦都行，\n要是你有的话，\n我会拿它跟你换。 
Well, not like it's going anywhere.
好吧，反正它不会跑掉。

Time to put this guy to work! Thanks!

I'm the director of operations here. The lead system administrator.

You would think that they would put me in a better office, but no.
你是不是以为他们会给我\n安排一个更好的办公室，\n但实际上并没有。
Apparently my "expertise" means I need to be "on- site"..."at all times"...
貌似我的“主任”头衔就是\n“主动加班”的主和...\n“任劳任怨”的任... 
Ugh. At least the Pokemon here keep me company.
啊，至少还有宝可梦陪着我。
Most of our servers are in here, but some of the older ones we keep in a room in the lower level.
大部分服务器都在这里了，\n但一些较为古老的则在底层。
It's pretty dark and dingy. I try to go there as little as possible.

The Seel seems distressed. It gives you and the worker nervous glances.
这只小海狮好像很焦虑，\n它不安地瞥了你和工人几眼。

它可能只是想离开这里，\n被困在货运箱里可不好受。
It doesn't seem like it will try to fight if you catch it.
如果你想抓住它，\n它或许不会反抗。

Hey, mind coming over here for a moment?

This Seel was stuck in one of the crates. No idea how.

Hello stranger.
你好，陌生人。
Are you here to find the gym leader as well? He has been quite elusive.
你也是来找道馆馆主的么？\n他向来都是神龙见首不见尾。 
I have come here to meditate. Doing so in such a place brings me peace.

I am going to be very honest with you.
我受不了了！

I don't want to compete in Makya anymore. I want to go somewhere that has a sane Pokemon League.

I caught this Magby for one reason -- to beat this gym.
之前我抓这只鸭宝宝...\n就是为了击败这个道馆。
Since I'm no longer trying, I want to trade it for something else.

Fighting me's better than fighting any of those Avatars, I'd wager. Prove me right?

Andris gave each of us -- us gym leaders -- one of these keys.
安德里斯给了馆主们各一把钥匙。
They’re for these doors, these prisons.

Behind all that bluster about Champions and badges and all that, this is our real purpose. At least, it’s supposed to be.
在接受挑战、颁发徽章等表象背后，\n但这才是我们真正的使命。\n也是事情本来的样貌。
Seems like I’m the only one taking this seriously.

Do I look like I have the time to duel you? That isn’t my job, you know.

My job is to guard this door until I can find someone strong enough to defeat what’s inside.

And for some insane reason they thought sending a parade of children at me was a good way to do that.

But fine. We’ll fight.
行行行，那我们就打一场。
I run doubles, and doubles only. You ready for that?

我来这里的唯一原因\n是找到一位真正的宝可梦大师，\n而你在与我对战的过程中\n所展现出的激烈攻势，\n也算符合了我的要求。
Fine. You’re here for more than an easy badge.
很好，我明白了。\n你来这里可不仅仅是为了枚徽章。
Show me what you got.
让我看看你有什么本事。
Sure thing. The sooner I lose to you, the sooner you get out of here and back somewhere safe, I suppose.

没错，你还是很厉害。
I can’t give you another badge.
但我没法再给你一枚徽章。
Please leave me alone.
请别烦我了。
I hope you’re happy.
我希望你会为此而高兴。
Suicidal dive into dangerous territory, hunt me down, force me to waste time fighting you.
冒着生命危险到这种地方来找我，\n逼我浪费时间和你战斗。
And for what, a big old game?
这一切都是为了什么，\n一场老掉牙的游戏吗？
Take your badge.
拿走你的徽章吧。
And, yeah, I’m not angry with you, got it? I’m angry with Helena and Andris and everyone for setting this up.
我没有生你的气。\n我是在生海伦娜、安德里斯，\n以及所有决策层的气。
Now get outta here, ‘kay?
现在可以走了吗？
Please, let's not do this right now.
拜托，别再来了。
When the tournament is on, it's the only time of the year I can take a break from handling crazy trainers all day.
联盟大赛举办期间，\n那是我一年中\n唯一能够好好休息的日子。
I'm gonna make the most of it, by relaxing...
我要好好利用，放松一下......
The door resists your attempts to open it with a mystic force.
这扇门上一股神秘的力量\n阻止你打开它。
Give me a sec.
稍等
Of course.
来吧

[Map107]
There’s a newly-painted sign here.
这里有个挺新的路牌。
It reads “Rafael gone. Connor is gym leader now?”
上面写着“拉斐尔走了，\n新馆主为康纳？？？？？”
There are many, many question marks.
后面跟着一长串问号。
An old combination lock keeps the door shut tight.
一把老式的密码锁\n将门紧紧地锁住了。
Reading off the slips of paper you found, you enter the code onto the locks.
你看着找到的纸条，\n输入着上面的密码。
After a bit of jostling, the lock opens!
轻轻地晃动一下，\n锁就打开了！
It takes eight digits, but with enough finagling you'd be able to open it with just <imp>four</imp>.
需要输入八位数字，\n但是只要耍点小聪明，\n只要有<imp>四</imp>位数字就可以穷举了。
Oh, heya.
哦，你好。
So... I'm a gym leader now. I guess.
所以...我就是道馆馆主...\n现在...大概...吧...
Didn't even really expect to see Rafeal again. He just kinda climbed down, patted me on the shoulder, and told me.
没想到再见到拉斐尔后，\n他只是轻轻地拍了拍我的肩膀...
Said all the paperwork or whatever was done. So, uh... yeah.
说所有的文件都办好了...\n然后...呃...我就...
Gym Leader Connor is coming soon!
总之，我现在之道馆馆主康纳。
Just need to get a proper doubles team together...
现在得试着组建一支\n适合双打的队伍...
WHOA!
哇！
WHAT KIND'A UGLY POKEMON ARE YA?!
你 是 什 么 东 西 ？
Rafael told me to battle any avatar that might come through here.
拉斐尔告诉我\n要跟所有通过这里的化身战斗。
I forgot my glasses at home today so I can't see anything more than a foot in front of me.
今天又忘了带眼镜，\n所以看什么都很模糊。
Sorry for confusing you with a Pokemon, you can pass through.
抱歉把你和宝可梦搞混了，\n你可以过去了。
Rafael is up ahead. Though, the door to the front is locked.
拉斐尔就在前面，\n不过，前门被锁住了。
If you want in, you'll need the combo code. I wrote the digits on some slips of paper, but lost 'em a while back.
如果你想进去，\n就需要输入密码。\n我把密码写在一些纸条上，\n但前阵子弄丢了。
Sorry, but if you want in to fight Rafael, you'll have to find those slips.
抱歉，如果你想和拉斐尔较量，\n就得先找到那些纸条。
The lock is really old, so you only need half of the eight digits, I'd wager.
当然如果你愿意动动脑，\n或许并不需要找到所有密码。
Rafael's Pokemon League Representative quit years ago, so I'll have to brief you on his team.
拉斐尔已经不做联盟代表好多年了，\n所以我得向你介绍一下他的队伍。 
Rafael uses a mix of Grass and Ghost-type Pokemon.
他喜欢用的是草和幽灵系的宝可梦。
This means that Fire, Flying, Ice, and Dark types do well here.
这就说明火、飞行、冰和恶\n四种属性可以在这里大展身手。
He's not just his types, however. He wouldn't have been able to guard this place for so long without a trick up his sleeve.
不过他对属性并没有那么依赖，\n能在这里担任这么久的馆主，\n多少都是有一些绝招的。
His team is built around the Dancer ability.
据说他的队伍核心是舞者特性。
When you see him send out his Bellossom or his Alolan Marowak...
等你看到他派出美丽花\n或者阿罗拉嘎啦嘎啦时...
Well, all I'm saying is be prepared.
嗯，我只能说，好好准备吧。
Best of luck, friend.
祝你好运，朋友。
You managed to win against Rafael?
你战胜了拉斐尔？
Great work, you got some real grit.
干得漂亮，你真有实力。
If the avatar problem here ever gets sorted out, I'll try to go watch your next high profile match live.
等这里的化身问题都搞定了，\n我就去现场观看你下场比赛。
Well I'll be damned.
我这是见鬼了么。
After all this time, I finally got to see Rafael leave his post.
这么长时间了，\n第一次看到拉斐尔离开他的岗位。
He had the biggest damn smile I've ever seen on him.
他脸上露出了迄今为止\n我见过的最灿烂的笑容。
You did good.
你做得很好。
You've probably saved me and Rafael a lot of cash as well.
这或许能帮我们节省一些资金。
We're down here most of the time, so we've lost a lot of money getting food delivered to us.
由于我们大部分时间都在这里，\n所以花了很多钱来运送食物。
Helena would probably kill us if she found out how much we've spent on delivery fees...
如果让海莲娜发现\n我们在送餐费上花了多少钱，\n她可能会杀了我们...
[Map108]

[Map110]
There's so many avatars around here. How am I ever supposed to get my badge?
这里的化身也太多了，\n我到底得怎样才能拿到徽章？
Man, if regular trainers are destroying me, no way I'm gonna beat the Gym Leader.
如果普通的训练家都能打败我，\n那我肯定打不过道馆馆主。
I have no idea where the Gym Leader is, but I do know one thing.
我不知道道馆馆主在哪里，\n但我清楚地知道一件事。
Avatars are scary!
化 身 真 可 怕！！！
I guess I'll take a break here to heal my Pokemon.
我还是先在这里休息一下吧。
[Map111]
[Map112]
This is a restricted area!
这里已经被征用了，\n闲人勿进！
I'm here to help with the avatars, so I don't think I'm supposed to help with your gym challenge.
我是来帮忙对付化身的，\n所以我没办法帮你挑战道馆。
Now go, before somebody overhears.
在被其他人看到前，\n赶紧离开这里。
I guess I have no choice but to let you go.
既然我拦不住你，\n那只能让你离开了。
I think I have to fight you again the next time I see you...
下次再见面时，\n我还会跟你打一场...
[Map113]
[Map114]
I've been assigned here to help with the avatar problem, but I don't really feel up to it.
我被上级派来帮忙解决化身...\n我？我真办不到...
Are you looking for the Gym Leader? I've only heard rumors.
你在找道馆馆主吗？\n我只听说过一些他的传言。
Apparently he's shacked up in one of the buildings.
说是他一直躲在一栋建筑里。
Dunno which one though.
但我不知道是哪一栋。
Well. I'll just be here. Chilling. Yeah.
好吧，来都来了，\n放松...放松下来...
I am chill. Calm. Relaxed. Chilled.
我很冷静，我很放松...

So it’s you again. I presume my impostor’s amulet is keeping you safe?
又是你...\n是那个冒牌货的护身符保护了你？
My name – our name – is <imp>Imogene</imp>.
我的名字...我们的名字...\n是<imp>伊莫珍</imp>。
The Ditto is around here somewhere, I imagine. I can’t ever lose her.
那个百变怪就在这附近，\n我想我们都不会失去彼此。
We were wandering Kalos before deciding to come home to Makya.
我们之前在卡洛斯游历，\n后来决定回到马凯亚。
If we can settle this matter of identity anywhere, it will be here.
这里应该是我们唯一，\n能分清谁真谁假的地方。
And as for this cave, I have a request.
至于这个洞窟，\n我有一个请求。
Indeed you can. I did not choose this barren cave at random.
的确需要你的帮助，\n我并不是随便选了这个地方。
It is a place of power, and I intend to prove myself the real Imogene once and for all.
这是一个拥有能量的地方，\n至少这一次，\n我要证明自己是真的伊莫珍。
*sigh*
*叹气*
I am the real Imogene. The other woman that looks like me is my Ditto doppelganger, who claims just the opposite.
我是真正的伊莫珍，\n那个长得像我一样的女人\n是我的百变怪分身，\n当然她的说法完全相反。
And I would like prove her wrong here and now.
我要在这里证明她是错的。
Fire-cracked bones can be read to divine the future. Ice forms a mirror that reflects oneself.
火烧骨可以用来占卜未来，\n冰则可以形成反映自己的镜子。
Let us combine the two – crater this ice with a duel and see our true identities in the fractures.
让我们把两者结合起来\n - 就在这个洞窟里决斗，\n让我们的真实身份在裂缝中显露。
Not without me you don’t! I’d rather you hex me than try and perform a reading without me!
必须我们一起来完成这一切！\n我宁愿你施咒诅咒我，也不希望你\n在没有我参与的情况下进行占卜！
The both of us, against our beloved traveler!
以我们两个，\n对抗我们心爱的旅行者！
Fine… I’ll hold my horses. But don’t leave us waiting.
好吧...我会等着你的，\n但不要让我们等太久。
Good! Quail before my inner fire, and reveal your soul to my eye!
好！在我的内心火焰面前屈服，\n让我看到你的灵魂！
…You battle with shocking clarity.
...你的战斗思路惊人地清晰。
Unbowed, even before the both of us.
即使在我们两人面前也不肯屈服。
Fascinating…
太有趣了...
These hairline fractures… the ice shrapnel… hmm.
这些细小的裂缝…\n冰雪弹片…嗯。
It portends nonsense. Gibberish.
这预示着...谎言。
That both of us are dead already, and the same regardless.
我们两个都已经死了，\n而且无论如何都是一样的。
And look at the scarring around our oh-so-helpful ritualist?
再来看看好心的协助者\n身边形成了怎样的痕迹吧。
So your name is \PN.
所以你的名字是\PN。
And, what, you will walk backwards? You are a bridge that opposes heroes and villains?
那么，你能稍微退后一点吗？\n你即是一座桥梁，\n又是英雄与恶棍？
Something about nostalgia, but I think you stepped on that part.
还有很多怀念的...\n那一部分被你踩到了。
Nothing of use, then. Not to us, at least. I hope our makeshift augury at least did you some good.
没什么很有用的东西，\n至少对我们来说是如此，\n希望我们的临时占卜\n至少对你能有所帮助。
If not, forgive this flight of fancy wasting your time. Remember: SHE came up with the idea.
如果没有的话，\n请原谅我们浪费了你的时间。\n另外，这是她出的主意。
Hmm… maybe this trip was worth more than that changeling imagines.
嗯…也许这次旅行\n比那个冒牌货想象得更有价值。
If you ever find yourself in the urban expanse with naught to do, find me.
如果你在什么地方无事可做了，\n那就去试着找我吧。
I’ll be at the riverside, like as not. I have plans involving you and yours.
我很可能会在河边，\n我可能有一些关于你\n还有你的宝可梦的计划。
Whoa! Is all well?
哇！一切都好吗？
Here – I suppose I can spare some supplies. Let us get your team in shape, shall we?
这些补给品给你了...\n应该可以抽调出一些来。\n让我帮你的宝可梦恢复好吗？
Go find out if my… companion… is ready.
去看看我的…伴侣…\n准备的怎么样了。
She requires far more preparation than I.
她总比我需要更长时间。
Have you made ready?
你准备好了吗？
If you ever find yourself in the <imp>urban expanse</imp> of Prizca with naught to do, find me.
如果你在大城市里无事可做了，\n来找我。
Why are you here?
你为什么在这？
Can I help?
我能帮忙吗？
...What?
...什么？
Hold up.
等一下
Let's go.
好的

The storage PC in the Pokemon Center here is busted, so we set up an impromptu one here.
夜幽市宝可梦中心的电脑\n已经链接不上了，\n所以我们在这里弄了个临时的。

你可以免费用。
We rangers are trying to keep the avatar problem here under control.
我们一直在试图控制这里的局势。
The results have been...
但结果一直不太理想...
Less than optimal.
它们太强了。

...Ain’t really feelin’ it today, \PN.
啊...我今天感觉不太好，\PN。
Y’know, I’m a fan of yours, gotta admit. Like your style. Like how you move. Like how you fight.
我不得不承认，\n现在是你的粉丝了，\n我喜欢你的风格和战斗方式。
Remind me of Yez, more than a li’l. But... I just ain’t feelin’ up to small talk. Today’s a day for big happenings, y’see?
你总是让我想到叶泽拉...\n不过今天我不打算闲聊，\n毕竟有一件大事正在发生，对吧？
Sure hope so. It ain’t exactly subtle. So, now, let’s figure this out 'tween you and me.
那就好，现在可不太妙，\n现在就由我们来解决它吧。
Which of us is better, who’s gonna be the one going down there, the whole shebang.
看看我们谁\n是那个最后解决掉一切的人。
You even gotta ask ‘bout that? Y’know how this goes. Always.
你连这都需要问我？\n你明明知道发生了什么。
Ain’t no other way for us folks. We got somethin’ to figure out: which one of us is gonna have to give Yez a talking-to.
我们没别的办法了，\n必须得找个机会，\n无论是你也好，我也罢，\n跟叶泽拉好好谈谈。
Oh, don’tcha go callin’ it a crush. Just got a lot of traits I’m half-partial to.
呃...这可不是那种“喜欢”，\n我只是欣赏你身上的某些特质。
Ain’t 'bout to change what we gotta do. One of us gotta go down there.
先别说这些了，正事要紧，\n我们当中必须有人下到最后。
I’m her friend. You’re her... well, you’re a lotta things.
我是她的朋友，而你...\n呃...你有很多身份。
I figure you got a better chance of beating her than I do, but I gotta double-check.
而且我觉得你比我更有机会打败她，\n不过现在我得再确认一下。
Aw, who am I kiddin’? I’m nervous, kid. I ain’t got the guts to face her and tell her what needs sayin’.
我不是在开玩笑，小家伙，\n我现在其实很紧张，\n我也不太确定该怎样面对她。
So c’mon. Gimme an excuse to give up.
所以，给我个放弃的借口。
Figured if there was one thing ya could do, it’d be this.
这就是我的理解之中，\n你能做到的事。
Hah! Knew I liked you.
哈哈，我果然很喜欢你的风格。
Nah. Never could say no to her, not when it mattered.
不，我怕我在关键时刻，\n无法狠下心来拒绝她。
You let me know when you’re 'bout ready, and we’ll do this. Ain’t no two ways about it.
准备好了就告诉我吧，\n这件事没得商量！
Take your time and make it good. I wanna be facin’ the whole nine yards, y’hear?
慢慢来，不着急，\n说不定关二爷还会给你九个圣杯呢！
Ah, good. Prove me right. Show me I ain’t nothin’.
很好，证明你比我更合适吧。
But, uh, I ain’t ‘bout to go down easy. \PN, meet the team I’ve been honing since the good ol’ days. Meet Drag-Mag.
不过...呃...我是不会轻易认输的，\n\PN，来见识一下我这些年的积累，\n以及曾经的特工“狂风”吧。
...'Bout figures.
...就是这样。
Well, I ain’t gonna sugarcoat it: it’s your job now. Always was, lookin’ at it a certain kinda way.
我不想粉饰什么太平，\n现在这是你的工作。
Go down there. Talk some sense into her. Y’know how. Ain’t much else to say, is there?
到下面去跟她讲讲道理，\n你知道该怎么做，\n不需要我多说了对吧？
You know whatcha gotta do. Don’t need me holdin’ your hand. Good kid.
你应该知道要怎么做，小家伙，\n你不需要我牵着你的手。
Oh, don’tcha go thankin’ me yet. I ain’t done nothin’ for ya. Nothin’ material.
哈，不用谢我，\n我什么都没为你做过，\n至少现在还是这样。
I was plannin’ to.
我当然也会出一份力。
I ain’t ‘bout to go down there myself with ya – it’s a private affair. Can’t ruin my reputation by barging on in and making a muck of things.
但我不想亲自跟你下去...\n我不想毁了自己的招牌，\n闯进去大闹一番，\n却最终把结果推向更糟。
Hah. Don’t embarrass me. Maybe after all’s said and done, we can grab a drink together.
哈哈，别让我难堪，\n或许等一切结束之后，\n我可以请你一起去喝一杯。
You, me, Yez... or just you and me, if that’s your drift.
你，我，还有叶泽拉...\n当然如果你想的话，\n也可以只有我们两个。
Just don’tcha go being one of those folks asking me to step on ‘em. Hah!
但你可别表现得像那些\n被我踩扁的讨厌家伙一样，哈哈！
You’re gonna need a li’l help to get to tomorrow, though.
为了明天，这是我对你的资助。
Take my Heatran. I don’t see myself fightin’ too many wars in my near future, and for anythin’ less my regulars will do well enough.
把我的席多蓝恩带走吧，\n将来我可能不会再打硬仗了，\n平时，一般的宝可梦也就够了。
You, though? You oughta take anything you can get.
你觉得呢？\n我不觉得你会拒绝这份提议。
Take good care of that damn thing, y’hear? We go way back.
好好照顾那个鬼东西，\n哈哈，怎么说也是老伙计了。
And, besides, it’s a damn juggernaut that can wreak more carnage than a babyface like you can even imagine.
别小看这个巨无霸，\n它所能造成的破坏，\n绝对远超你这“娃娃脸”的想象。
Hah! I ain’t never been able to tell if you’re brave or stupid. In my experience, they ain’t much different.
哈哈，我一直都分辨不出，\n你到底是勇敢还是愚蠢，\n虽说以我的经验，这两者没区别。
As you say, though. Ain’t gonna complain 'bout keepin’ an extra ace up my sleeve.
当然，我当然不会抱怨，\n自己手里能多留一张王牌。
Well, I s’pose we oughta keep it brief, all things considered. You gotta go hunt that girl down, and I gotta go prep for either which way it ends.
我们还是长话短说，\n去追上那个女孩吧，\n而我得为一切可能的结局做准备。
I’ll be seein’ her soon, one way or another. Probably won’t be too keen on seein’ me, but that’s friends for ya.
不管怎样，我很快就会见到她...\n当然她可能不太想见到我吧，\n但这就是朋友，哈哈！
Hey, \PN, I figure this comes as an awful surprise to you, but I got a secret.
对了，\PN，\n你可能...会对我接下来，\n所说的这个秘密感到惊讶。
Up until now, I’ve been workin’ with Yez, clandestine-like. Masked, causin’ havoc, fightin’ you. I ain’t proud of it, but it ain’t far from my usual.
其实在此之前，\n我一直在跟叶泽拉合作...那些...\n制造混乱也好，和你对决也罢...\n这与我的一贯作风差别不大，\n但我不会以此为荣。
I’m a black ops gal born and raised, though I’m a mite more on the side of cut-and-burn than cloak-and- dagger.
我是一个在这里土生土长的探员，\n虽然我更擅长暴力解决对手，\n而不是戴上面具做一个忍者。
I ain’t 'bout to apologize. But, uh, Yez’d have me stoppin’ you, and I ain’t 'bout to play that game.
我不会为这些事情道歉的，\n但是...呃...叶泽拉肯定会让我阻止你，\n我却不想再玩这种游戏了。
She got other lackeys, good on her, but I ain't gonna be one of 'em.
她还有其他的支持者，\n但我不会再是其中之一了。
Go ruin her day, kid. I’ll see you around.
去给她当头一棒吧，\n回头见，小家伙。
Hey, next time I see ya, drinks are on me. Call it my way of making up to you. Heh. So long, kid.
对了，别忘了下次见面的邀约，\n一起去喝一杯，就当是补偿了，\n再见！
\PN, go ruin her day. I wish I was good enough to do it myself, but I just ain’t.
\PN，去毁了她的计划吧，\n我当然也想亲自这样做，\n但...我还是狠不下心...
You understand her well enough. She’ll listen to you, one way or the other.
你很了解她不是吗？\n起码她多少会听你的话。
And, uh, sorry. For makin’ this all ‘bout her. If things were any different, I’d love to chat ‘bout other things.
而且...呃...对不起，\n如果没有这一档子事的话，\n我倒是很乐意跟你聊些别的。
Maybe some day, yeah? I’ll see you around, I promise.
或许会有能放下一切的一天...\n回头再见吧，我保证会来找你。
You come back and there’s still bars left in the world, drinks are on me, y’hear? See ya around, kid.
如果等你回来之后，\n这个世界的酒馆还在，\n那我们就去喝一杯吧，\n走了，小家伙！

Congratulations! You decimated Zain in the tournament, and my boots on the ground are telling me that you’ve done some extracurriculars.
首先恭喜你在比赛中击败了赞恩，\n听说你还做了一些其它的事情。
Saved the region, I hear? Very impressive, \PN. You shattered my wildest expectations.
比如说拯救了那个地区？\n这真是超出我最高期待的答卷，\n我对你很满意，\PN。
Now, I haven’t been able to get in contact with Zain, but to be honest, after that showing...? I’m not sure we have much to talk about right now.
不过，自从比赛后\n我就联系不上赞恩了...\n当然也没什么可跟他谈的。
Ignore him, though. He’s just moping because he couldn’t beat you. To be honest, I never thought he could.
或许只是因为输给你而闷闷不乐吧，\n而且我从没想过他能赢。
Today’s about you. Aww, honey, you did so well! I can get a private flight scheduled to get you back home ASAP. I’ve got big plans for you.
现在就不聊他了，亲爱的，\n我可以尽快安排私人航班接你回来，\n还给你准备了一个大计划。

So, what date works for you to come home?
那，你定个日子吧。
Tomorrow morning? Or do you want to sleep in? We’ll make it tomorrow evening, just in case.
明天早上？或者说你想睡个懒觉？\n那就安排在明天晚上？
You – you what? Excuse me? Is there some kind of arrangement I don’t know about?
你...你说什么？我没听错？\n你有什么我不知道的安排？
Are you – are you eloping? Have you been offered a job there? You do understand what –
你要跟谁私奔吗？\n有人给你在那里工作的机会吗？\n你要明白...
Oh, good. I’ll start making plans for our vacation immediately.
好的，我这就开始计划我们的假期。
You’ve worked so hard and...
你这段时间辛苦了，而且...
Mavis continues on for a few minutes before she lets you go.
梅维斯又继续讲了几分钟，\n然后才让你挂断电话。
She says she loves you, and goodbye, and she’ll see you again soon.
她说她爱你，\n还说很快就会再见面。
You’ll tell her that a certain someone said hi when you meet her next.
下次见到她时，\n你会告诉她某个人的问候。
You’ll be her second-in-command and second-to-last.
你将成为她的副手\n以及最重要的人。
...You thought it’d make you feel warmer.
…你觉得这会让你感觉更温暖。
You’ve never not picked up for your mother before.
你以前从来没有\n不接你母亲的电话。
It’s Mavis. You have to answer.
你必须接电话。
...No, you don’t.
但也未必。

You might be able to tell, but a certain Nurse aid in training is feeling a bit wild today...
你可能能看得出来，\n我这个护士今天心情不太好...
This Happiny has been a troublemaker since day one, always trying to battle the patients.
这个小福蛋一直在制造麻烦，\n总是跟病人产生冲突。
I got an idea. If you can beat it in a battle, it'll demand to join your team.
我有个注意，如果你能打败它，\n那就把它带走吧！
It'll thrive with a trainer. What do you say?
有个训练家的话，\n它就能茁壮成长了。
I just want to get it off the cliff so we can get out of here.
我真想给它丢下悬崖，\n这样我就能回家了。
Place feels dangerous.
当然只是说气话。
Wonderful. Give me a second.
太好了，给我一点时间。
HEY! YOU GOT SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BATTLE!
嘿！有 人 要 跟 你 战 斗 ！
GET DOWN HERE!
下 来 吧 ！
Thanks for that.
谢谢你。
As expected, it's practically dying to join your party.
果然，只有这样它才愿意加入。
Well, I suppose that's three months of training down the drain.
虽然这三个月的训练都白费了...
Peace.
谢天谢地。
My mom told me not to come up here, but I really wanted to see what it was like to pee off the side of a mountain.
我妈妈不让我来这里，\n但我真想体验一下站在悬崖边，\n往下撒尿是什么感觉。
I uh... don't need to pee anymore. For no real reason.
我...再也不尿尿了...\n我是说在这种地方。
I felt like peeing off Makya's highest point would be great, but I'm not feeling as liberated as I thought I would be.
我觉得从马凯亚的最高峰\n往下尿尿的体验一定很棒，\n但并没有那种想象中的解放感。
I'm scared of heights, but I'm more scared of growing old without making memories.
我有点恐高，\n但我更怕老去后\n没有值得回忆的东西。
That's why I choose where I pee very carefully.
因此，我会非常谨慎地\n选择撒尿地点。
\PN! My beloved! The mountains frame your beauty in a way I can only describe as sublime.
\PN！我的爱人！\n这山脉将你的美丽框在了\n一种我无法形容的崇高之中。
You look as if you could tear them down around you and build yourself a throne.
仿佛它要将自己拆解掉，\n形成属于你的王座。
You don’t need to. All you need is me.
当然你不需要这样它，\n你只需要我。
Of course. I always have time to talk with you. Listening to your dulcet voice makes my worries dissipate.
当然可以，\n我有很多可以和你闲聊的时间，\n你悦耳的声音能让我的烦恼消散。
We can talk about anything. Anything at all.
你想谈论些什么都可以，\n任何事情都可以。
Why would you come here if not for me? You could’ve stayed away.
如果不是为了我，\n你为什么会来这里？\n你本可以远离我。
What draws you to me? You know what it is, I think. We both know. I’d love to show you what you really feel.
是什么吸引你来找我的？\n我想你知道这个原因，\n我们都很清楚，\n向你自己展示真正的感受吧。
You’re perfect. I see all my love reflected in your eyes. It’s beautiful. I want to hold you so badly.
你是那么的完美，\n我看到你的爱意从眼神中\n毫无保留的映射出来，\n太美了，我多想抱着你！
Oh, you’re adorable. Such a pure creature.
啊！你真是太可爱了！\n竟然有如此纯洁的生命。
Yes, my love. Always gifts. I’ll get you anything you desire, always. You’re worth more than any material object.
放心吧，我的爱人，\n我永远都有东西给你，\n无论你想要什么，我都会给你，\n这就是我对你爱的重量。
...But that must come later.
...不过那必须稍后再说。
\PN. I had planned to propose to you here. But then I was gifted a miracle.
\PN，\n我本想在这里向你求婚，\n但一个奇迹打破了我原本的计划。
My undying, fervent wish was made real before my eyes. Our love was consecrated in the eyes of the heavens.
我那不朽与热烈的愿望，\n就这样在眼前变成了现实，\n是我们的爱得到了天堂的祝福。
I knew this gift to us was to be used only one way. You are like Yezera: there’s one language you speak above all others.
不过这份礼物的包装，\n只有一种拆解方式，\n那就是你和叶泽拉一样，\n最擅长的那种语言。
I’ve been so selfish, using my words to express how wonderful you are. I should’ve been speaking your language.
我一直都那么自私，\n自顾自地用干瘪的语言\n表达你的美好，\n我应该换一种你能听懂的方式。
Let me show you my love. Let me show you the sign I have received. Let our love be made immortal by this glorious omen, shining in the passions of combat.
让我展示我的爱吧，\n让我展示我所接收到的征兆，\n让我们的爱因这个\n光荣的征兆而不朽，\n在战斗的激情中闪耀。
Of course, my love. Make yourself ready.
当然，我的爱人，\n我也不希望你是仓促应战。
I love you. Allow me to show you just how much.
我爱你。\n让我向你展示这份爱的浓郁吧。
...I won’t let you slip away. You’re mine, \PN.
…我不会让你溜走的，\n你是我的，\PN。
You don’t understand what I mean yet. Let me show it to you. Let me open your eyes to the love you’ve been missing.
你还不明白我的意思吗？\n让我毫不保留地展示给你看吧，\n让我揭开你一直缺失的爱的眼帘。
This is meant to be. Witness the message the heavens gave me.
这是命中注定的，\n是所见证的上天给我的信息。
You’re making me wait. My heart is pounding. I can’t wait any longer. Will you now bear witness to this sign of our eternal love?
在等待的过程中，\n我的心一直怦怦跳动，\n我再也等不了了，\n来见证我们永恒爱情的征召吧！
Do you see it? The wish-bringer, come to grant me my wish! The light of our love shining through it! And you, like a star, like an avatar!
你看到了吗？\n愿望的化身来实现我的期盼了！\n我们的爱之光因为它闪耀！\n而你，像一颗星星，\n一个化身般闪耀！
I wanted Yezera, and I sought the avatars, all to lead me here. To woo a god, and make you mine forever.
无论是叶泽拉，还是化身，\n我追求他们，都是为了今天，\n让命运把我带到这里的一刻。\n追寻神的步伐，让你永远属于我。
Can’t you see? I will do anything for you.
你应该能看得出来吧？\n我会为你做任何事情。
I will move heaven and earth. I will love you eternally. I will smother you in compassion and affection. I will fill your life with comfort and pleasure.
我会永远爱你，\n我会为你移山填海，披荆斩棘，\n我会用关怀和爱意淹没你，\n让你的生活只剩舒适和愉悦。
I will steal for you. Kill for you. End this world for you, or remake it to be more pleasant for you. So long as you are mine.
我会为了你成为窃贼，\n为你杀戮，为你毁灭世界，\n又或者重塑世界，使其更美好，\n只要你能属于我...
So long as I can hold you, and love you, and know that you are mine and no one else’s.
只要我能拥抱你，爱你，\n并确保你是我的，\n不是其他什么人的...
I need help? That’s all you can say to me?
我需要治疗？\n这就是你要对我说的全部？
I love you more than anyone has loved anything! Do you expect me to keep it inside, wear masks, be... civil about it?
我爱你胜过任何人，\n胜过任何事物！\n你希望我把它藏在心里，\n戴上面具，表现得...文明些？
It drives me to madness and back not embracing you here and now! As it should! Everyone else is blind not seeing your radiance!
无法现在拥抱你会让我疯掉！\n这才是最该有的结果！\n其他人都瞎了，看不到你的光辉！
You are gorgeous and brilliant and divine. What higher accomplishment could there be than to make you mine?
你那么美丽、聪明、神圣，\n让你成为我的，\n就是此世间最珍贵的成就！
No one could aspire to anything better, except to be you.
除了成为你之外，\n没有人能找到更好的追求。
I would for you. Don’t you understand that?
为了你，我愿意下地狱，\n你难道还不明白吗？
Why would you reject me? I could make your life perfect!
你为什么要拒绝我？\n我可以让你的生活变得完美！
I would do anything for you, and you want to throw that away? Simply because I ask for your love in return? Am I not worthy of that, after everything?
我愿意为你做任何事情，\n而你却想要抛弃我？\n仅仅因为我要求你回报我的爱？\n在经历了这一切之后，\n我难道不值得被爱吗？
I am kind, and loving, and caring, and humble, and I can see your real worth!
我善良、谦虚、有爱心，\n也懂得关怀别人，\n还能看到你真正的价值！
Shouldn’t I be more worthy of love than anyone else? Do you think I’m insane?
难道我不比任何人\n都更值得被爱吗？\n你认为我疯了吗？
You’re the mad one here if you think you’ll be better off without me. A beautiful mad god that refuses to be helped...
你认为没有我会更好？\n哈哈，原来是你疯了，\n一个美丽的疯狂之神，\n拒绝接受信徒的帮助…
No! I will have you alone. I couldn’t stand to share you with anyone else!
不！你只能有我一个人，\n我无法忍受与其他人分享你！
Please, you won’t even notice. I will fill your days with joy. You won’t need anyone else.
求求你，你可能没注意到，\n我会让你的生活充满快乐，\n你不再需要其他任何人。
If they ask for you, if they want you, I’ll take care of them. They can serve you – us – or they can leave. Our perfect days need no one else.
如果他们需要你，\n如果他们想要你，\n我会代你照顾他们。\n他们可以为你，为我们...\n服务，或者离开，\n我们完美的生活不再需要任何人。
After all, I’m the only one that feels this raging love. I’m the only one that knows what you really are. Radiant. Divine.
毕竟，只有我能感受到\n这股炽烈的爱，\n只有我知晓你真正的本质，\n那份光辉与神圣！
Yes. Of course. Hah! Everything is as it should be.
没错，就是这样，哈哈！\n一切就应该这样发展！
The entire world is falling into place, my love. You are mine. Forever.
整个世界都在我手手中了，\n我的爱人，你是我的，永远！
Love, I’ve been working with Yezera to reset the world. I planned to rule with her, and then later I planned to make it a paradise for us two.
亲爱的，我之前一直\n在和叶泽拉一起重置世界，\n我原本计划和她一起统治，\n再为我们两个打造一个天堂的。
But now? You’re fighting Yezera, and I’ll gladly choose you over her. She’s nothing to me now. You’re the only one that matters.
但现在，你是她的对立面，\n我也很乐意选择你而不是她，\n她对我来说已经毫无意义了，\n你是唯一重要的人。
How about this? You go take care of her and make sure she never bothers us. Meanwhile, I’ll be making preparations.
怎么样？你去解决掉她，\n确保她不会再来打扰我们吧，\n同时，我也会做好准备。
I’ll make your life a dream. A beautiful, idyllic, paradisiacal dream from which you’ll never wake up. Go do what you do best.
我会让你拥有梦境般的生活，\n一个美丽、闲适的梦境，\n你永远都不需要醒来的梦境。\n而现在，继续去做你擅长的事吧。
Oh, the plans I have. My love, just you wait. Please. Don’t hurry yourself. Although... you must have work to attend to.
我有数不清的计划，我的爱人，\n在等等吧，请不要着急，\n而且...你还有些事情要处理。
Oh, please, continue then. I wouldn’t dare take you away from what you do best.
请继续吧，\n我不会让你停下那些。
I need time to prepare, and you need to wrap up these loose ends. Cut these threads away. You don’t need anyone else now.
我需要时间来准备未来，\n而你需要结束这一些的源头，\n当变故被全部切断之后，\n你就不再需要任何人了。
\PN, I’m going to make your life a dream. You’re a god... and now you’re mine.
\PN，我会让你的生活\n变成一场美好的梦境，\n现在...你就是独属于我的神明了。
We’ll be together forever. Forever’s just beginning, and I’m a patient man.
我们将永远在一起，\n不...永远也只是开始，\n我是一个有耐心的人。
So go ahead. Get rid of Yezera. Get rid of everyone! And then come back to me, so I can hold you.
所以继续吧，摆脱叶泽拉，\n摆脱其他所有人！\n然后回到我身边，让我拥抱你。
Here. Take Jirachi with you. A sign of my undying love, and our divine bond.
不如，带上基拉祈，\n这是我永恒的爱\n和我们之间神圣连结的象征。
I love you, \PN. My gift to you is a god, because what else could suffice?
我爱你，\PN，\n送给你一份传说中的礼物，\n没有什么是比这更好的了。
Take it, and know you’re loved. Loved more than anyone else.
拿上它吧，你将时刻感知到，\n你被爱着，\n比以往任何时刻都更多，更充盈的爱。
No? Oh, \PN, you don’t have to leave it with me.
你不打算带走它？\n\PN，你没必要把它留给我。
If it isn’t good enough for you, I’ll make it up to you. Anything you desire, you’ll have. Just let me work out the details, alright?
如果你觉得这份礼物还不够，\n我将来会再补偿你的，\n无论你想要什么我都会给你，\n让我来处理这些，好吗？
You’re gorgeous. You’re perfect beyond words. And you’re mine. All mine.
你的美，无与伦比，\n而且你是我的，全部都是我的。
So go on. We can be apart for a little while more. I’ll be thinking of you every second you’re away.
现在继续你的旅程吧，\n我们可以再分开一段时间，\n我每一秒都会想念你。
I’ve got preparations to make. Time to set aside, items to procure, people to... obviate.
接下来我要做好一切的准备，\n安排时间、采购物品、处理麻烦...
We’ll meet again. And then we’ll never meet again, because we’ll never be apart.
等我们再次相遇，\n就永远不会再分开，\n因为...这就是我永恒的爱！
Goodbye, \PN. I love you more than anything in the world.
再见，\PN，\n我爱你胜过世间一切。
The stone hums with power.

Go on, back to your climbing or whatever you like to do.
继续去做你喜欢的事情吧。
Do you even have hobbies?
你有什么爱好吗？
You’re leaving me? Why?
你要离开我？为什么？
I was going to create a perfect world for you. Do you know that?
你知道吗？我本来要\n创造一个属于我们的完美世界！
Yezera wants a new world. I don’t care why. It gave me the perfect canvas. An ancient, divine land. A golden age! And this time it’d never end!
叶泽拉想要一个新的世界，\n我不在乎她的目的，\n但这给了我一块完美的画布，\n给了我古老而神圣的土地！\n我可以让黄金时代永不终结！
I would have her... or you.
我会拥有她...或者你。
I served her whims here, helping her, fighting you, stealing the titans. And I would serve her in the reborn world, love her forever.
我本在那里为她服务，\n帮助她与你战斗，偷走巨人...\n在重生的世界里，\n我也会继续为她服务，永远爱她。
But now that you have shone upon me, I couldn’t ever go back to her. She pales in comparison. So now no one will receive this endless love.
但现在你照亮了我，\n我再也无法回到她身边，\n她现在已经显得没那么美好了...\n所以现在没有人能得到\n我这份无尽的爱。
I will never build a new world for my beloved. And I will never have a god to call mine.
我永远都无法为我所爱的人\n创造全新的世界了，\n我永远都无法拥有自己的神了。
...Fine. You’ll regret this. They all will.
呵...你会后悔的...\n你们所有人都会后悔的！
They’ll all die cold and alone, withering unloved and unremembered.
你们都会孤独地死去，\n没有人爱，没有人记得。
You could’ve been happy. And now the fire smolders to embers and ash. I hope you choke on it.
你本可以很幸福，\n现在火焰只剩灰烬和余温，\n我只希望它能把你们呛住！
You – no!
你...不！
Why would you give me hope just to rip it away? Why would you do this to me?
为什么你要给我希望，\n然后又将它撕碎？\n为什么你要这样对我？
I have worshiped you! I have loved you! I have always loved you!
我那么崇敬你，那么爱你！\n一直、一直都是这样！
Gods come to earth, turning their backs on me! Do I deserve this? Have I failed you in a single way?
神明降临人间，却背弃了我！\n难道我不配吗？\n我到底是哪里做错了？
No! I am pure, and holy! My love is divine!
不！我是纯洁而神圣的！\n我的爱是最神圣的！
Fine then! If you want to cast me into darkness, do so. If my love burns too brightly even for the heavens, cast me down.
既然...连你都想将我扔进黑暗，\n那就这样吧...\n如果连天堂都无法容纳我的爱，\n那就将我驱逐吧...
You can’t stop me. You can’t snuff me out. You’ll be mine eventually. One of the gods will.
但你无法阻止我，无法扼杀我的！\n你，或者是其他神明中的一个，\n总有一个，总有一天会是我的！
All I need is one to love forever. One to be mine, and mine alone. I won’t stop until I have one to keep.
我只需要一个永远爱我的人，\n一个属于我...只属于我的人！\n我会不停地追求，直到拥有...
I love you. I love you more than anything. And I’ll never see you again.
我爱你，我比谁都更爱你，\n但我再也见不到你了。
Maybe we’ll meet in another eternity, when I have a god of my own to love and care for. And then we’ll see if you regret this.
也许我们会在另一个永恒中相遇，\n当我拥有自己的神明去爱和照顾时，\n到时再看看你是否会后悔吧。
Jirachi seems perturbed. It seems to have gravely misjudged the situation.
基拉祈似乎感到不安，\n它似乎严重地误判了情况。
It also seems apologetic. Perhaps it wants to make it up to you, or keep you safe.
它也似乎感到很抱歉，\n也许它也想弥补你受到的伤害，\n或者保护你免受伤害。
Maybe it’s even attracted by your adamant hopes and wishes.
也许它被你坚定的希望\n和绝不妥协的愿望所吸引。
In any case, it seems willing to be caught by you.
总之，它看起来想跟你走。
How Skyler was blessed by a mythical granter of wishes, you’ll never know.
你无论如何都想不明白，\n为什么斯凯勒会被传说中的\n愿望的象征祝福。
Jirachi seems highly embarrassed and gladly lets itself be caught. Honestly, it seems like it just wants to forget this ever happened.
基拉祈似乎非常尴尬，\n但也很高兴自己能弥补，\n其实，它更想就此忘记这件事情。
Jirachi seems disappointed. You suspect it wanted to be caught and battle some more as a palate cleanser.
基拉祈似乎很失望，\n你怀疑它到底为什么会祝福斯凯勒，\n总有种莫名的不安。
As an immortal being, though, it’s got plenty of time to forget this ever happened.
不过，作为一个不朽的存在，\n它有足够的时间忘记这件事情。
It leaves with the mountain wind. Perhaps you’ll see it again on these snowy peaks...
它随着山风离开了，\n也许你会在这雪山上再次见到它...
The true power of the Dragon-type is only unlocked during an Eclipse!
只有日食的时候，\n才能解放龙系真正的力量！
The only problem here is my own. I have failed my Pokemon.

I shall return to my thoughts, and I will come back more focused.

How d’ya do? Can’t beat the stench out here.
你好吗？\n呕...这里的气味真是难闻。
Sinuses ain’t stung this bad since that shot of Reuniclus liquid came back up.
自从喝掉液态的人造细胞卵后，\n我的鼻子就没这么难受过了。
Ah, I don’t get paid to complain, though. This Trubbish is bein’ real stubborn.
不过我不是来抱怨的，\n只是这破破袋真是太顽固了。
Mind lendin’ a hand? The way folks like us do?
能帮我个忙吗？\n像我们这样的人得互帮互助吧？
I’m a trainer. Real trainer, too – I train, y’see.
我是一名“训练家”。\n字面意义上的训练家。
Train people’s Pokémon for money. We had a scuffle back in Novo Town… which ya won.
我通过帮别人训练宝可梦赚钱，\n之前我们不是在望新镇打过一次？
If ya wanna know more than that, shame. We got a business relationship, yeah?
如果你想知道更多，那...\n我们现在有业务关系吗？
Now give me that rematch.
要不，现在来场复赛吧。
Tch. Cold.
啊，冷酷无情。
Welp, I’ll just park my ass here till this sack o’ trash works up the nerve to get its feet wet.
好，那我就坐在这里，\n等那个破破袋慢慢鼓起勇气吧。
Get that toxin pumpin’, ya know?
让它体内的毒素流动起来。
You’re one of them reliable sorts, ain’tcha? Disgusting.
你是那种可靠的人，对吧？\n嘶，起鸡皮疙瘩了。
Ah, I kid, I kid! Nice to see a little innocence ‘round these parts.
来吧，孩子！\n我很高兴能在这里看到一丝纯洁。
Now c’mon, show me your vicious side.
现在展示你凶残的一面。
Got a bin liner to train and nobody to keep me company.
我现在有个破破袋需要训练，\n但是没人陪我。
Mind lendin’ a hand?
你能帮帮我吗？
Ah, I kid, I kid! Nice to see a little innocence 'round these parts.
来吧，孩子！\n我很高兴能在这里看到一丝纯洁。
Ya see that? I knew you had a mean side.
看吧，我就知道你有凶狠的一面。
Downright sadistic. Always good to have a bit o’ your inner psychopath available.
简直是残忍无情！\n不过内心中有一点变态是好事。
Real ace up your sleeve kinda deal, y’see what I’m sayin’?
这就相当于掌握了一张\n别人很难去提防的王牌。
Babyface like you got plenty of room to blindside somebody.
尤其是你长着这样一张娃娃脸，\n结果突然出手偷袭。
Love to see it happen, love to see ya take it to heart.
我喜欢看到这种桥段，\n也很高兴看到你对此很用心。
You’re a hero. Look at yourself.
你是一个英雄，看看你自己吧。
But don’t get pinned down by the role – have some fun with it.
但是不要被这个角色束缚太深，\n要玩得开心一点。
Play the rival a bit, yeah? Be a heel.
类似于...扮演一个劲敌？\n像一个恶棍那样的。
Ah, nevermind me. Maybe you’re better at playing the hero, through and through.
啊，不必在意我的话，\n或许你更适合扮演英雄。
Me? I’m a rival. I ain’t your rival, but I was a rival.
我？我的确算是个劲敌，\n或者说曾经是，但肯定不是你的。
I wasn’t ever meant for big things, ya know? But I help keep heroes on their toes.
我从来都没做过什么大事，\n但我会帮助英雄完成那些。
And, hell, maybe I have some fun along the way. Make some friends, yeah?
并且...算了，或许...\n我也该在路上玩得开心些，\n多交些朋友对吧？
Those days are behind me, but ya can’t teach me new tricks.
不过那些日子已经过去了，\n我得找点新的乐子。
Fightin’ you feels like old times. I 'preciate it.
但说回来，与你对战，\n让我想到了曾经，感到有些激动。
The name’s <imp>Alessa</imp>, by the by.
顺便说一下，我是<imp>阿莱莎</imp>。
'Fraid I can’t chat any longer, though. I’m off to the big city.
抱歉，我不能继续跟你聊了，\n现在得去大城市了。
Some bigshot CEO’s kid needs his reserves trained up ASAP.
某个大亨的孩子，\n需要尽快训练他的后备军。
So, see ya 'round. Don’tcha keep me waitin’.
那么，再见了。\n另外，别让我等太久！
It is always important to give back from where you have taken!
回报取决于付出！
My friend and I have been feeding the Munchlax down here as thanks for providing us with important battle items.
我和我的朋友\n一直在喂养这里的小卡比兽，\n以感谢它们提供重要的战斗物品。
We've done our part, but perhaps you would like to join us? The Pokemon down here love Big Malasadas.
我们已经做了该有的付出，\n或许你也想加入？\n这里的宝可梦喜欢大马拉萨达。
If you could get a batch of ten from the LuxTech food vendor, we could do a little bit of good.
如果你能从光华的\n食品供应商那里拿到十个，\n我们就能日行一善了。
That is alright Trainer, my friend and I have more than enough.
没关系，训练家，\n我们手里的已经足够了。
But consider my offer! It is not about wealth, it is about reciprocity.
但请着重考虑我的提议！\n这不是财富问题，\n而是互惠互利的问题。
Fantastic! The Pokemon here will appreciate your kindness!
太棒了！这里的宝可梦\n会感激你的善良！
I don't see enough for a batch, Trainer. Perhaps you are mistaken.
训练家，你这好像不对啊。
Big Malasadas are sold at the LuxTech Campus. You should be able to purchase a batch there.
大马拉萨达可以在光华园区买，\n这玩意还挺常见的。
It would be foolish of me to talk about reciprocity and not reciprocate!
既然是互惠互利，\n那怎么能没有回报呢！
Here, Trainer. It is not much, but it is a gift.
这是给你的礼物，训练家。\n虽然不多，但是心意到了。
Enjoy the world, Trainer. It is there for us, and we are there for it.
享受这个世界吧，训练家。\n它为我们而存在，\n我们也为它而存在。
These Pokemon are happy as a direct result of your actions.
这些宝可梦的快乐\n是由于你的行动带来的。
Not every Pokemon will have a grand adventure with a Trainer.
并不是每个宝可梦\n都会和训练家一起去冒险。
It is important to remember that those Pokemon matter just the same.
一定要记住，这些宝可梦同样重要。
You know, I feel a little bad about stealing all those Leftovers from the Pokemon down here...
我现在后悔从这里的宝可梦那\n偷走所有吃剩的东西了…
It reeks down here, but the Pokemon in this place are pretty friendly.
这里闻起来很臭，\n但这里的宝可梦非常友好。
They're more used to human contact than most, given how these are sewers and all.
考虑到这里是下水道，\n它们比大多数宝可梦\n更习惯人类的接触。
You're a LuxTech employee, aren't you?!
你是光华的员工吗？
I'm gonna steal your TMs!
我要偷走你的技能机！
Silver Ninjask isn't going to be happy...
银色的铁面忍者可不会高兴...
Now this job's gone completely sideways. Thanks a lot.
现在工作都搞砸了，\n真特么的谢谢。

I'm an out-of-towner visiting family.
我是从外地来这里探亲的。
There aren't many Normal-types where I live. The only one I was able to get was a Sentret.
在我的家乡，一般系的宝可梦很少，\n唯一能买到的就是尾立。
Not the Makyan one.
当然不是这里的那种尾立。
If you want it, I'll trade you a 'mon in the Loyal tribe for it. Want to keep my team cohesive.
如果你想要一只的话，\n就拿一只忠诚之心部族的\n宝可梦来交换吧，\n这样对我的队伍也有所帮助\n（在箱子里选择宝可梦）。
Ah alright, I'll keep looking for one.
好吧，好吧，\n我会继续寻找愿意交换的训练家。
Maybe I'll find something in the area west of here.
也许我可以在西边那片区域\n找到合适的宝可梦。
Nice! You won't regret this.
太棒了，你不会后悔的。
Sweet, this little guy is gonna go for an adventure.
我会带着这个小家伙一起冒险的。
I hope you enjoy that Sentret, it's pretty rare here.
我希望你能喜欢这只尾立，\n毕竟它们在这里很罕见。
Only authorized personnel are allowed through this door.

She's pretty cool.
因为她很酷！
Huh?
哈？
Didn't my shift end already?
已经过下班时间了？
Something's gone wrong here.
那我还在这里干嘛。
Always make sure to read what you can on open, unlocked computers.
只要有权限阅读，\n一定要看完电脑上的所有信息。

How long has it been since I've seen Dolly? Eight years?
我跟多莉已经多久没见过了？\n大概...八年？
It’s almost surreal seeing her again. So much has changed...
没想到还能再见到她，\n毕竟这时间足以发生太多变化了...
You got a key?
你有通行许可吗？
Understood. Head right on in, trainer.
那你可以进去，训练家。
You got a key for the lab?
你有实验室的许可吗？
If not, we can't let you in.
没有许可是不能进的。
I do research on which types are strong against other types.
我曾对属性克制关系做了些研究。
For example, Psychic-type is strong against Steel-type.
比如说超能系可以克制钢系。
Most people don't know that!
很多人连这都不知道！
Of course, it's intuitive once you look at how well Alakazam handles its metal spoons!
只要观察下胡地是怎么玩勺子的，\n就能搞懂这个原理了！
Grass-types are the best. I love how pure and natural they are.
草属性是最棒的！\n我喜欢这种生机盎然的纯净感。
My entire team shrugs off magical attacks like they're nothing!
我的宝可梦们\n都能轻松抵抗魔法攻击！
Oh, by "magical" I mean Psychic, Fairy, and Ghost- type.
呃，我说的“魔法攻击”\n指的是超能、妖精和幽灵属性。
Natural beats supernatural any day of the week, in my book.
毕竟，自然的力量\n总能战胜那些超自然的东西。
Oh, Dolly! I thought I’d never see you again!
多莉！\n我还以为再也见不到你了！
And you -- I can’t thank you enough for getting her back to me. How’d you find her?
真的...非常感谢你，\n能让她再回到我身边。\n你是怎么找到她的？
Oh, uh... well, don’t worry about that.
呃...那不重要。
Anyways, uh, gotta see a man about a Poochyena. Toodles!
或许是靠土狼犬的鼻子呢？\n总之，再见！
Umph!
诶！
It’s you! Uh...
是你！呃...
Well, I mean, like, technically yeah.
嗯，我是说...大概...\n技术层面上来讲没错。
But they stole them first! Team Chasm needs to pay back its dues, y’hear me? They stole those Pokémon years ago!
但是是他们先偷走的了！\n裂隙队需要为他们的所作所为负责！\n你应该知道吧，\n这些宝可梦是他们几年前偷走的！
Yeah, you got it!
没错，看来你知道内情！
I, like, totally can’t stand the idea of some ex-Team Chasm jerks keeping some Pokémon that prolly still wants to go back home.
我...大概...\n完全不能接受前裂隙队的成员，\n强行保留那些想要回家的宝可梦。
I, uh, guess I maybe kinda should’ve explained that earlier.
我...呃...\n我应该早点解释清楚的。
But, like, hey, no harm no foul, right? My name’s <imp>Candy</imp>.
但是，大概...\n嘿嘿，应该没关系吧？\n我是<imp>糖儿</imp>。
And you’re \PN -- I know, like, everything about you. So, hey, you’re cool. You, uh, want to team up?
我知道你是\PN - \n我听说过你的...大概...一切！\n所以，你，很酷！\n你愿意跟我合作吗？
Yeaaah, damn straight. Finally got a friend my age. Go Candy!
耶！！！大成功！\n终于找到一个年龄相仿的朋友了！\n加油吧，糖儿！
Anyways, I’ll 100% be in touch. So we can inflict some more justice.
总之，我之后100%会跟你联系的，\n这样我们就能一起为正义而奋斗了。
Sayonara!
再见咯！
Oof. Rejected hard.
哦...被决绝了。
Welp, that’s your loss! Hell, if you keep working with Tamarind and Andris, I might just be your next rival!
行吧，这是你的损失！\n哼，如果你继续跟塔玛琳\n或安德里斯他们合作，\n我就会成为你的下一个对手！
Watch your back!
小心你的脑袋！
The Fossil Research Lab has so many fossils that we're just giving them away!
化石研究所里积累的化石太多了，\n所以我们经常会送出去一些！
You can pay to get your fossils revived, too.
你也可以使用化石复活技术。
Talk to my associate in the room to our left.

Premise 1: Ice both resists and is super-effective against Ground.
知识点1：冰属性不仅对地面属性强力，\n还有很强的抵御其攻击的抗性。
Premise 2: Rock both resists and is super-effective against Ice.
知识点2：岩石属性不仅克制冰属性，\n还可以抵抗冰属性的伤害。
Final premise: Ground is super-effective against Rock.
知识点3：地面属性可以克制岩石属性。
Conclusion: To maintain consistency, Ground must resist Rock!
结论：为了保持均衡，\n地面属性就得抵抗岩石才对！
The world is just perfectly balanced, isn't it?
真是令人愉悦的均衡，不是吗？
Now I just need to figure out what's going on with Psychic...
现在我只需要再搞明白超能的话...
Dolly here got, uh, reappropriated by Team Chasm... how long has it been? Eight years?
自多莉被裂隙队强征到现在...\n已经...七八年了吧？

Welcome to Novo College!
欢迎来到望新大学！
Feel free to check out any of our labs and classrooms to learn what kind of place we are.
我们的教室和实验室，\n在正常情况下完全对外开放，\n您可以随意参观。
You can also log onto the PC over there to read lots about our history, our majors, and other stuff.
如果您想了解我们的历史、\n研究、录取信息等内容，\n可以移步一旁的电脑进行查看。
Greetings. I hope you’ve come prepared to answer a few questions.
你好，我能问你几个问题吗？
Thank you. I would like a firsthand account.
谢谢，这对我的调查很有帮助。
Concerning the avatars and their effects.
一些关于化身的问题。
No, but I would appreciate it.
当然不是，我只是在做一个调查。
Understandable. I require more data, however.
我只是希望您能参与调查...
Upon more elaborate consideration, I decided to not have you present our findings with me.
这样吧，我不做过多的讲述了，\n只是问几个最简单的问题如何？
I think you’ll be glad to hear that. I would like to hear your personal opinions, though.
毕竟每一位受访者，\n对我来说都是宝贵的数据。
Could you give me an estimate of how many avatars you have fought during your time in Makya?
你能告诉我在马凯亚，\n一共解决掉多少化身了吗？
Significantly more encounters than the average individual, certainly.
那至少比一般人见得多。
That many? Noted.
这么多？
I have my own estimates based on public records and hearsay. I will default to those.
那我就根据公共数据大致估测一下吧。
Do you take no thrill in defeating these beings? Unfortunately I fear you may be an expert in the matter.
你是不是已经觉得它们没什么挑战性了？\n听起来你比我想象中经验更为丰富。
So, have you noticed any common traits between avatars?
那你有没有发现它们身上的什么特质？
As the local people have found out.
大家都这么说。
I will trust your judgment, as an experienced battler.
一个经验丰富的战士都这么说，\n那这个结论的可靠程度会很高。
Ah, yes. I’ve heard of this phenomenon.
啊，对，我也听说过这个事。
I have my suspicions that the true nature of the avatars and Makya’s unique properties share a common origin.
我一直怀疑化身\n和马凯亚的特有地区形态\n有同根同源的关系。
The unique ecological pressures that create the Makyan forms must stem from the same source as the avatars. I’m certain of it.
或许迫使它们进化的生存压力，\n便来源于这些化身。
This region has several pockets of blatantly unnatural climatology – its immense cave network chief among them.
要知道这里有些地方的气候明显不自然，\n尤其是那些地下洞穴中。
There is more to this region than I have discovered thus far.
想必这片土地上，\n还有更多人类未曾发现的秘密。
...But, excuse me. I am not asking questions. I am talking your ear off.
而且...呃...抱歉。\n这已经不是在做调查了，\n只是没忍住说多了而已。
I need to collect my findings to present to the local experts in regional forms and the ranger captains.
我必须整理好情报和推论，\n并将其交给教授和义军军官看看。
I would like to talk with you again. Do you know the <imp>menagerie in Velenz</imp>?
我觉得我们可以展开深度合作。\n你知道 <imp>夜幽市生态园</imp> 吗？
I would suggest we meet there.
我们在那里见吧。
Though, considering the timing, it would perhaps be better to wait until after the tournament is over. That way at least one burden will be off your mind.
不过，考虑到时间问题...\n或许可以等到联盟大会结束之后，\n这样不至于耽误你自己的事情。
In fact, if it may help you in achieving a quick victory, take these.
为了帮你快速取胜，\n这个就给你了。
Best of luck. Goodbye, \PN.
祝你好运，再见，\PN。
Welcome to the Novo College Informational Site! Please select one of the following subjects to learn more!
欢迎来到望新大学信息站！\n请选择您要浏览的信息内容！
Makyan paleontology is in an exciting time. Recent excursions have promised field-shaking discoveries.
目前，马凯亚的古生物研究\n正处于一个关键阶段，\n一些近期的发现甚至会\n颠覆学界的普遍认知。
The avatar crisis has only existed for less than half a year, but already fossil analysis has found striking resemblances to ancient Pokemon.
在化身出现的不到半年时间中，\n根据现在已经掌握的证据和资料，\n发现其与古代宝可梦之间\n有着许多惊人的相似之处。
Skeletons found by researchers are significantly larger than the bone structure of modern counterparts.
其骨骼形态和规模，\n明显比现代生物更庞大。
Novo College has an accoladed history in the material sciences.
望新大学在材料科学研究上\n有着悠久的历史。
The Rematerializer was voted by Trainers as one of the most useful inventions in the last decade.
我们发明的重塑打印机\n被训练家们评选为\n过去十年中最有用的发明之一。
We also work closely with Pokemon Centers in order to improve medicinal practices.
同时我们还在积极寻求\n与宝可梦中的合作，\n来改善各地的医疗设施。
Makya has a stunningly biodiverse ecosystem, which has raised the mystery of how it got to that point.
马凯亚地区生态系统的多样性，\n一直是各地学者重点研究的课题。
One theory is that immigration to the region has brought stowaway Pokemon, or foreign Pokemon released into the wild.
部分学者认为，\n是外来移民带来了\n本不属于这里的宝可梦，\n并因各种原因将其释放到野外。
Another theory is the Makyan environmental policy is particularly effective.
另一部分学者认为，\n是马凯亚地区出色的生态治理，\n使得更多生命可以在此繁衍。
For both theories, the counterargument is that fossil records show that Makya has had this biodiversity before human settlements were even founded.
但根据古生物研究，\n早在有人类定居之前，\n马凯亚地区的生物种群数量\n就已经达到了一个很高的数值。
In collaboration with Eko, Novo Town's Gym Leader, Novo Colllege is developing new pain-relief medication for Pokemon.
望新大学目前正在\n与望新道馆馆主艾克一并，\n研究新型的宝可梦止痛药。
While status-relieving medicine serves a purpose, its main flaw is that it is reactive rather than proactive.
目前市面上的状态类药物，\n虽也有一定的止痛效果，\n但一直无法解决\n不能由宝可梦自主使用的缺点。
As a response to this issue, the College has been working to develop a new ointment, which can be applied to Pokemon once a day.
为了绕开自主使用的难题，\n本院校正在努力开发新型药膏，
Unlike existing medicines, it serves to stop status pains before they happen.
与现有药物不同，\n我们希望新的药品，\n能在疼痛出现之前\n便阻断神经元对痛感的反应。
Pokemon in the midst of battle will still feel the effects, long-term pain will be numbed a few minutes after combat.
在对战中的宝可梦\n仍然会受到突然刺激型痛感的影响，\n但可以免除持续型痛感的影响。
Career battling Pokemon benefit most from this, as continued exposure to untreated status can result in chronic pains once the Pokemon retires from battling.
这种药物适用于职业对战宝可梦，\n如果对其滥用，\n导致长时间处于药物作用状态，\n很可能会使其患上慢性疼痛。
The avatar crisis has disrupted much of Makya's already strained infrastructure, as travel between settlements has become quite dangerous.
化身的出现极大影响了\n本就不够发达的马凯亚基础设施，\n城际间的联络也会因此变得危险。
To help combat this, Novo College has been offering free courses to Trainers and Rangers who wish to keep Makyan routes safe.
为了暂时缓解这些问题，\n望新大学一直在为\n负责线路安全工作的\n训练家和义军提供免费课程。
Multiple professors and students work to develop new strategies to defeat these avatars.
目前有多位教授和学生，\n正在研究有效对付化身的技巧。
Experienced Trainers with a history of battling avatars are encouraged to volunteer in educational roles.
我们呼吁社会各界\n有化身对战经验的训练家\n能够自愿参与此项目。
One of the College's latest projects involved tracking genetic signatures in the Golett, Baltoy, and Castform families.
我校最近开设了新的项目，\n人为干预哥达鸭、天秤偶\n和漂浮泡泡的家族基因序列。
While the exact methods of reproduction elude scientists, many suspect that selection forces remain at play.
目前参与的学者们，\n还在对测试用的繁育方法进行商讨，\n且其具体可行性仍受到质疑。
How this natural selection impacts man-made Pokemon could have remarkable insights on how other Pokemon change form over millennia.
我们无法确定自然选择\n是否会干扰到人造宝可梦的形成。
Applications for the current school year are closed.
入学申请入口暂已关闭。
Acceptance letters will be sent out shortly.
录取通知将很快送达。
LuxTech Scholars will be contacted by a representative on their first week of classes.
来自光华市的学生\n将会在开学一周之内得到通知。
Our college isn't too grand, but we have three ace areas.
这所大学虽然不算顶尖，\n但却有三个王牌专业。
Paleontology, 3D printing, and electronics.
古生物考古，3D打印，\n以及电子科技。
When you combine them, you get the largest fossil studies and revival program in the world!
试想一下，如果将这三者结合起来，\n就会产生世界上最大的\n化石研究和复兴项目！

Grouz Station Captain, at your service.
你好，我是古治站站长。
Don't know why nobody stopped you at the cave mouth, but I guess that's all you can expect from grunts.
虽然不知道为什么没人拦住你，\n但我也并不因此感到奇怪。
Unless you got a proper ID card, we're not gonna let you through.
除非你有正式的身份卡，\n否则我们不会让你通过。
Too many would-be heroes have gotten themselves hurt fighting the Avatar in there...
我们见过太多自称为英雄的人，\n在里面被化身打成重伤了...
How'd you get your hands on a Chasm ID Card?
你怎么会有裂隙队的身份卡？
Don't tell me you stole that thing just to fight these Avatars.
别告诉我你是为了跟化身战斗，\n才去偷身份卡的。
Not sure if that's brave or just stupid.
真不知道该说你勇敢还是愚蠢。
Due to policy, I've got to let you through regardless of how I feel. Ridiculous, I know.
呵，出于政策，无论我怎么想，\n都得让你通过，真是荒谬。
Hah! If a single Ranger here had half of your grit I'd never have worry about anything.
哈哈！如果这里的义军\n有你一半的勇气和实力，\n我就不需要再操这么多心了。
Since we let you through to fight the Avatar, how about you keep quiet about beating it?
出于我们让你通过的交换，\n请你暂时不要告诉外界，\n这里的化身已经被打败了，好吗？
They won't notice for a few days at least.
这样，应该能拖几天的时间。
Allow me and my team a well deserved vacation.
足够让士兵们休息休息了。
This assignment sucks...
这任务糟透了...
You get yourself a few badges as a hobby and all of a sudden they say you're getting drafted into this mess...
我本来只是处于爱好\n去挑战了几个道馆，\n然后就突然被征召进义军了...
I could see all those flashy moves from back here...
从这里我都能看到那些花哨的招数…
Almost caught a stray shot!
还差点被流弹击中！
A right proper mess this is.
真是糟了个大糕！
None of us are getting paid enough for throwing our Pokemon at this Suicune over and over.
我们拿到的那一点工资，\n根本抵不上在这里\n跟水君玩命对战的工作量。
Can't even remember the last time I got more than five hours of sleep...
上一次一觉超过五小时\n已经是多久之前的事情了...
Need me a right proper bonus after this.
我需要一笔丰厚的奖金作为报酬！
Mans needs a full night of sleep as well.
我还需要睡一个好觉！
[Map125]
Whoa, careful kid. Ain't no adventure for you past here 'less you know what'cha doin'.
哇，注意安全，孩子！\n你知道这里是什么地方吗？
Can't let'cha through 'less you got the proper clearance.
除非你有许可，\n否则不能通过。
That gate ain't opening for any ol' Trainer that wanders in.
我们不会允许\n冒然闯进来的训练家通过那扇门的。
I ain't gon' stop you since you got yerself the proper clearance.
既然你有通行证，\n那我就可以让你过去了。
Ain't gon' like it, since you're just gonna get your behind handed to ya.
虽说我自己不愿这么做，\n毕竟你也只会被打败。
We'll I'll be darned! You took it down!
我惊了！你打赢了！
Yer good in my books kid. Ain't seen battlin' like that since my days as a grunt.
你干得很漂亮，孩子！\n自我从军以来，\n就没见过这样的战斗了！
The Svait Rescue Op owes ya one. I'm glad this crisis is a bit closer to bein' over.

You think you can best that monster? Best of luck.
你觉得你能打败那个怪物？\n那就祝你好运吧。
Takes 3 of us to just keep it from escaping...
每次阻止它跑出去，\n都需要我们三个人合力才行...
When you challenged that Avatar, I thought you just had as much pride as a Pyroar.
之前你要挑战这个化身时，\n我以为你只是个\n跟火炎狮一样自大的家伙。
But wow, you've got the skills to justify it.
但是你证明了的确有这份实力。
If everyone in Makya was as good as you, the Avatar Crisis would be an Avatar Inconvenience.
如果马凯亚能多一些\n像你这样优秀的人，\n化身带来的危机就是小问题了。
All I wanted was to attend the Makyan championships!
我只是来马凯亚参加竞技大会的！
How'd I even get involved with the Avatar of Entei of all things?
为什么会被卷入\n炎帝化身的防务工作当中啊？
I go to boarding school in Paldea and Team Star ropes me into their plans...
我一开始在帕底亚上学，\n然后莫名其妙加入了天星队...
I go to Galar and end up on a Team Yell cheer squad...
后来去了伽勒尔，\n又在旅店被呐喊队选中...
I got to Alola and I'm working for every famous evil dude under the sun?!
在之后去了阿罗拉，\n又无意之中帮某个\n邪恶老大干了不少脏活...
And now this?! I need to rethink how I travel...
为什么现在又是这种感觉？\n我是不是该改改自己的旅行习惯...
[Map126]
Stand ho! We have gathered here to appraiseth a bundle of treasures most wondrous!
站住！\n我们正在评估宝物的价值！
Longeth has't we taken to accrue this, and thee shall findeth it prudent to leaveth us to our work!
这是我们长久努力的回报，\n请你不要自讨没趣！
UNLESS!
难道...
Un. Less.
难道！
Thee dareth challenge us, for stake over such a wond'rous horde?!
你想要独吞这些宝藏？\n想要挑战我们？
Staking a claim on this? That'd be a mis-stake if you ask me!
真是个愚蠢的决定！
Quite indeed, mine own comedic companion!
没错，我的搭档！
Say, Great Sage Rennyo, doth thee knoweth this person who hast happened upon us?
伟大又神圣的雷尼奥，\n你认识这个突然出现的人吗？
I see.
我明白了。
Well, what shalt thee doth anon stranger?
好吧，陌生人，\n我想结果应该不会有什么变化。
Shall thee square us in a Pokemon battleth most enjoyable? Or shall thee cower before our combined might...
你要和我们进行一场\n最有趣的宝可梦战斗吗？\n还是在我们的联合面前退缩…
Fare thee well then, stranger. We shalt stayeth here and do our work, until a true challenger comes.
那好吧，陌生人，\n我们会继续待在这里，\n等待真正的挑战者。
Very well! Approach, stranger!
好的，那就来吧！
Bested at last!
终于被打败了！

A voice rings out from further into the cave.
山洞深处传来了吵闹声。
Lo! We hast finally found the treasure we hast been seeking!
我们终于找到这个宝藏了！
A heavy crate. Its front side lock has been broken off.
一个沉重的板条箱，\n锁头已经被保利拆解掉了。
There are items inside!
里面好像有些东西！
No
不
Yes
是
[Map127]
Stat changes affect Avatars, sure, but they have the ability to remove the negative changes somehow.
降低能力的招式对化身也有用，\n但效果不如一般宝可梦明显。
Perhaps stat-changing moves are more common wherever they come from.
也许这种变化类招式对他们来说，\n只不过是平常的开胃小菜？
Among the garbage, you see what remains of a MasterBall, crushed completely flat.
垃圾桶里，\n有一个被压成球片儿的大师球...
I'd rather you not interrupt my lecture.
请不要打扰我讲课。
This information about avatars could save lives.
这些关于化身的知识点，\n或许就能挽救某人的生命。
I tried to face an Ursaring avatar up in the Split Peaks.
我曾在嵌口峰面对过圈圈熊化身。
I thought I'd be clever and use my Sinistea and my Duskull to completely negate its attacks.
我当时耍了点小聪明，\n试图用来悲茶和夜巡灵免疫攻击。
I learned the hard way that avatars can ignore immunities. With their Empowered moves, at least.
然后我就学到了\n化身无视免疫这个重要知识点，\n起码它们强化后的招式如此。
The damage was enough to send me packing. Later that day I heard that Victoire was able to take it down.
然后我就灰溜溜地逃走了，\n直到晚些时候，\n听说最后是薇克特尔击败了它。
I bet that battle was a real carnival!
那一定是一场令人热血沸腾的激战！
If an avatar takes enough damage, it might retaliate with a special kind of move.
当一个化身受到足够多的伤害后，\n就会使用一种极其特殊的招式。
Not only is the move powerful, it changes the typing of the avatar itself!
这种招式拥有强大的威力，\n能够帮助它们恢复伤势，\n还可以改变它们自身的属性！
Make sure your team isn't caught off guard by a sudden matchup reversal.
挑战化身时一定要考虑好，\n自己的宝可梦是否有\n完全处理不了的属性变化。
Most Pokemon are only able to have one status problem at a time.
大多数宝可梦\n同时只会陷入一种异常状态。
Avatars, on the other hand, have no such defenses.
但是，化身并不在此列。
You can have an avatar that's burned and numbed simultaneously!
你可以让一个化身同时被麻痹和灼伤。
It's strange to consider what biological differences might have caused this discrepency.
这真是一种令人感到不解的\n生物差异性表现。
A ranger buddy of mine told me about the Avatars of Entei, Raikou, and Suicune.
我有个义军朋友跟我说，\n他曾面对过炎帝、雷公和水君的化身。
He fought them, but won't tell me where at, the coward.
但是他没告诉我这些化身在哪儿，\n谁知道是不是在吹牛。
Though, maybe he's right to not get others involved.
不过话说回来，如果是真的，\n为了不牵扯进他人而保密也可以理解。
He's got three badges, and even then he failed to make a dent.
但我还是觉得他在吹牛，\n他也不过只拿到了三枚徽章而已。
During my field studies, I noticed that the avatars rarely attacked the same Pokemon over and over.
通过对数据的研究，我发现\n化身很少连续攻击同一只宝可梦。
They seemed to have a regular rhythm of switching who they were being aggressive against.
它们似乎在按照一种固定的节奏，\n切换它们攻击的对象。
Holding back to avoid being too lethal? Or something else?
难不成是良心发现不想下死手？\n谁知道呢！
The board is scribbled with field research notes about an Avatar of Vileplume.
黑板上详细地写着\n霸王花化身的详细资料。
Apparently a lot of stinky flowers bloomed nearby after it appeared. Gross!
在它出现之后，\n附近开出了很多散发着臭味的花！
[Map128]
I'll take your Pokémon for a few seconds.
请允许我暂时拿走您的宝可梦。
First, you should restore your Pokémon to full health.
现在你的宝可梦已经恢复活力了。
We hope you excel!
祝您一路顺风！
\PN! Nice to see you.
\PN！能见到你真好。
I mean, you're the champion, now, so I suppose its only natural that you'd try take on the Battle Monument.
我是说，你现在是冠军了，\n所以我理所当然的希望你\n能来参加战斗纪念塔的挑战。
I did some consulting work on the trainer AI, so I'm very aware that its quite a challenge.
我之前做过训练家AI的咨询工作，\n所以我知道这有多难。
Good luck!
祝你好运！

Since the gym can't hire six whole Trainers, some of us employees have to pull double duty.
道馆的经费根本无法\n同时负担六位训练家，\n因此大家都要做一些兼职。
Whew, I can't stand up to you.
哇，我受不了你了。
I get paid a nice bonus for the overtime, so I don't mind too much.
我会得到一笔可观的加班费，\n所以我不太介意。
I'll be collecting a nice check at the end of the month, hoho!
月底我会得到一笔\n可观的加班费，嘿嘿！
Hah. I knew I’d see your face again.
哈，我就知道我\n还会再次见到你的面孔。
*hiss* A challenger?
*嘶嘶声* 挑战者？
Ignore the poser and let’s cut to the chase: this is gonna be a double battle. Us two versus you.
别理那个装模作样的家伙，\n让我们直奔主题：\n你，想要得到徽章，\n我，想要在某人面前炫耀一下。
Don’t ask why; it’s complicated and don’t change the facts.
不要问为什么，很复杂，\n而且这个事实也改变不了。
You want the badge. I want to style on someone.
你，想要得到徽章，\n我，想要在某人面前炫耀一下。
And because of… circumstances… we’ve got to include the clout chaser in the mix.
由于…一些不可抗力…\n我们还得让那个家伙加入进来。
So, you down? Think you’re tough enough to take on me and Bence at the same time?
所以，你有什么打算？\n你觉得能同时对付我和本斯吗？
*hiss* Fine. You’ll be back soon enough.
*嘶嘶声* 好吧，\n很快，你就会回来的。
Y-you will be back, right?
你会回来的，对吧？
*hiss* You remind me of a girl I once knew. You ain’t her.
*嘶嘶声* 你让我想起了一个认识的女孩，\n但你不是她。
I’d tell you to stop pretending, but how ‘bout Bence and I just teach an object lesson, huh?
别再装模作样了，\n让我和本斯给你上一堂实战课吧！
*hiss* We were trained by the girl who swept Team Chasm.
*嘶嘶声* 训练我们的人，\n可是那个曾经横扫了裂隙队的女孩。
Now I’m ‘bout to sweep you. Don’t take it personally, ‘kay?
我可能要让你扫兴了，\n但别往心里去，好吗？
Oh, you got Zoé riled up?
哦？你把佐伊惹毛了？
You are NOT gonna like how this goes, friend.
最好别这样做，朋友。
We don’t agree on much, but if you think you’re like our teacher, we’re gonna humble you REAL fast.
虽说我们在很多问题上无法达成一致，\n但如果你自以为能比肩我们的老师，\n我们会教给你什么叫做谦卑。
Time for the grand two versus one?
是时候来一场盛大的二打一了？
Oh, you are NOT going to regret this!
希望你之后不会后悔！
Do whatever it is you do for luck, ‘cause you’re gonna need it!
做点祈祷什么的吧，\n或许能派得上用场！
*hiss* Clear as day. You’re just better.
*嘶嘶声* 一目了然，你更强！
Humility isn’t my strong suit, but I’m not stupid. Least, not as stupid as Bence thinks I am.
谦虚不是我的风格，\n但这不代表我很自大，\n至少，我不像本斯那么蠢。
*hiss* Damn.
*嘶嘶声* 该死。
Well, you won. Flying colors. A+ grade.
好吧，你赢了。\n非常出色，A+等级。
Always good to see someone that can keep pace with me. And isn’t as smug about it as Bence.
我其实很高兴看到\n有人能跟上我的步伐，\n而且没有本斯那么自大。
Take our badge.
拿走我们的徽章。
And since a little bird told me you’ve got friends in high places, put in a good word for me, eh?
而且有只小鸟告诉我\n你认识高层人物，\n能替我说句好话吗？
*hiss* Bence is too much of a square to get involved with anything illegal.
*嘶嘶声* 本斯太过老实，\n对很多事情缺少变通。
And this is. Probably.
而这个，很可能...
Our mentor walked out one day out of the blue. Left us to manage the gym.
那天我们的导师突然离开了，\n并让我们来管理这个体育馆。
But she left behind instructions: if we find someone as good as her, give them this key, tell them to go through the door, and stand back.
她同时留下了指示：\n如果我们找到了像她一样优秀的人，\n就把这把钥匙给他们，\n让他们通过那扇门，\n然后就没有然后了。
That’s you.
那个人就是你。
Do it.
来吧。
Meet me at the shed near the river.
在河边的小屋见我。
This gym is a mess! How am I expected to battle properly?
这个道馆真是一团糟，\n让我怎么好好战斗？
This whole situation is a disgrace! I'm going to help clean up.
从头到尾都是耻辱，\n都得让我去收拾残局。
One day they might agree on something...
总有一天他们能达成一致...
I wish I still worked for Helena.
我要是海伦娜的员工该多好啊。
Zoé’s left several emails open at once.
佐伊同时打开了好几封邮件。
One’s from Bence, saying that he’s going to go on a journey of self-discovery better than hers.
第一封是本斯写的，\n说他要踏上一场\n比她更好的自我实现之旅。
Another is from a perfume company inquiring about hiring her for Ceruledge-themed advertisements.
第二封是一家香水公司的，\n想要邀请她拍摄一段\n以苍炎刃鬼为主题的广告。
The third is her sending pictures of Ceruledge to several people, asking if they knew about the Pokémon. She seems extremely impressed by it.
第三封是她发给别人的邮件，\n询问朋友们苍炎刃鬼是什么宝可梦，\n看来她对此很上心。
Yo, champ in the making!
哟，未来的冠军！
We have two Gym Leaders here on the West side of Prizca.
西宏礼道馆有两个馆主。
Bence and Zoe are Rock-type and Flying-type users.
那就是使用岩石\n和飞行系的本斯和佐伊。
There isn't a magic typing here that I could recommend you. These types are a pretty good combo.
在这里并没有什么\n特别好的属性可以推荐给你，\n因为这个组合相当给力。
Steel might be your best bet.
相对来讲最好的选择应该是钢。
Water and Rock are a close second.
再就是水和岩石。
There are two paths that each challenger can take, though you can switch between them whenever.
每位挑战者都可以\n选择任意一条路线进行挑战，\n当然你也可以随时换一条路。
Try to pick and choose which Trainers are the easiest for you to take down.
尽量选择对你来说更简单的把。
Nice one, you took 'em down!
干得好，你把他们打败了
Keep at it and you'll go far.
继续努力，你会走得更远。
I'm not a full time Trainer, I just work here.
我不是全职训练家，\n我只是来上班的。
I thought I'd try a hand at battlin', but I guess I need to be a bit better.
我觉得我可以试试参加对战，\n但必须得更强一些。
Oooh that was fun, maybe I'll do that again.
哦，真有意思，\n我想再来一场了。
I really just work here...
我的确是来上班的...
Welcome to West Prizca's Gym, how tough are ya?
欢迎来到西宏礼道馆，\n那么，你有多强呢？
Go right ahead.
请进。
Yeah, so what if you beat me?
你就算赢了又如何？
How tough am I?
我到底有多强？
Good question kid.
好问题，孩子。
*hiss* So that’s that. Bit of a mess.
*嘶嘶声* 就这样吧，有点乱。
But you’ve got a real knack for handling chaos, huh? You remind me of… whatever.
但你真的很擅长处理混乱，\n没错吧？你让我想起了...\n唉...不重要。
Zoé! Show some respect to the future champion, huh?
佐伊，对未来的冠军\n尊重一些，好吗？
Take the badge, my friend: you’ve earned it.
拿着这个徽章：你赢得了它。
You were UNTOUCHABLE; just incredible!
你是无敌的！
And Zoé’s wrong. We don’t need to watch you.
另外，别听佐伊说的，\n我们不是要盯着你。
You’re the one we were told to find.
而是因为，\n你就是我们要找的人。
Uh, as much as I hate to say it, I’ve gotta let Zoé take care of this one. She knows what to say.
嗯，尽管我不想这么说，\n但我得让佐伊继续处理，\n她知道该接下来是什么。
Not right now.
稍等
Hell yeah.
来吧
Give me a sec.
等一下
Yeah, I do.
来吧

My family has trained here for generations.

This place always always seems to draw in those on great journeys. I take advantage of that to watch history first-hand.
这里总是吸引着\n那些踏上伟大旅程的人，\n我也在利用这个机会亲眼见证历史。
I have had the pleasure of battling every champion in this region.
我曾经有幸与这个地区的\n每一位冠军战斗过。
I've lost everytime, but each is an unforgettable learning experience.
虽然我每次都输了，\n但都是难忘的学习经历。
They say each drop of light carries a memory of triumph.
他们说泛着光的水滴中\n携带着胜利的记忆。
Memories adrift, floating dreams. An aspiration fulfilled, yet peace sickens them. Do you find yourself here?
飘摇的记忆，浮动的梦想，\n当愿望实现了，那份平静，\n反而让人们感到恶心。\n那你在这里找到本我了吗？
Perhaps your victories will end up here, one day.
你的胜利终有一天\n会在这里结束。
Spend enough time here and it begins to feel like a forum.
在这里待的时间足够久后，\n就越来越觉得它像个祭坛。

Lambert's House
兰伯特家
I've summered here for 20 years.
我已经在这儿度过了20个夏天。
I must say it really went to the dogs once Team Chasm started moving in.
从裂隙队接管这里开始，\n真是一年不如一年。
I especially don't like the gym leader they stationed here.
尤其是他们派来的那个道馆馆主！
Before all this, he was a bartender at some establishment for roustabouts.
要知道他之前可是个\n流浪汉酒吧的调酒师！
Hey, kiddo. What’s goin’ on? I heard you’re following me.
哟，小鬼，咋回事？\n听说我后面有个跟屁虫啊！
Well, go right ahead. Not gonna get a Beedrill in my bonnet over some kid toddling after me.
当然，我肯定不在意，\n你爱咋咋地。
By the time you find me, I’ll be Champion, and mom will have her mind made up.
不过等你追上我的时候，\n我肯定已经是冠军了，\n别到时候在妈妈面前哭鼻子哦！
Yeah, sure, make it sound like a real competition.
好，好，这才有竞争的样子。
What? Persian got your tongue? Whatever -- I didn’t call to hear you talk.
咋了？无话可说了？\n随便吧，反正我也不是\n为了听你说什么废话才打电话的，
Tsk, tsk. Feisty little runt.
哦，炸毛了？
You’re at the gym in that villa, right? Real gaudy place. I remember the gym -- want some advice?
你应该在那个俗气的破岛上对吧？\n该挑战那个道馆对吧？\n需要我给你一些建议吗？
Too bad. If you can’t beat that gym, you don’t deserve to even be in this competition. Bye!
菜就多练，连那个道馆都打不过，\n还妄图能超过我？再见！
You’ve always needed my help. Fine -- prove me wrong. We’ll talk again.
哼，早晚你会发现，\n没有了我的帮助你什么都做不到，\n争取一会儿不要哭着求我哟！
I volunteer at the PokeCenter here sometimes.
我有时会在这里的\n宝可梦中心当志愿者。
So many trainers come in with Numbed Pokemon after battling Lambert.
有很多训练家都会在\n跟兰伯特对战后，\n带着被麻痹的宝可梦前来求助。
Apparently a lot of new trainers struggle with that status, as it halves the Pokemon's speed and reduces the damage they do.
很多新手训练家都对\n这种异常状态非常苦恼，\n因为它不仅会让宝可梦的速度减半，\n还会降低所造成的伤害。
"Casaba Villa, Makya's #1 Vacation Spot"
"欢迎来到在马凯亚地区\n遥遥领先的--甜瓜度假村"
Greetings!
您好！
If appearances are to be believed, you seem to be a fine trainer.
如果我没看走眼，\n你一定是一位不错的训练家。
I'll be challenging the gym here soon, but need a bit more practice with this team in particular.
我正在为挑战这里的道馆做准备，\n但我的宝可梦还需要一些实战训练。
After all, my goal is to defeat the leader without any of my Pokemon fainting.
毕竟，我的目标是取得完胜，\n也就是在没有任何宝可梦昏倒\n的前提下击败道馆馆主！
Therefore, I'd like to battle you, if you have the time.
所以，如果你有时间的话，\n我希望能跟你一起训练！
Call me <imp>Vanya</imp>.
你可以叫我<imp>凡雅</imp>，
Know that I am unique among trainers.
一个独一无二非常优秀的训练家！
In my quest for perfect victories, I have suffered perfect defeats as well.
虽然在追求完胜的过程中，\n我也曾遭受过完败，
Near everyone runs off after a bad loss, but not I.
但我不会像一般人那样落荒而逃！
You can <imp>perfect</imp> my team all you want, and I'll <imp>stay right here</imp>.
就算你真能赐予我<imp>完败</imp>，\n我也会做好<imp>下一次对决的准备</imp>。
If you would indeed like to battle me, and the team I've assembled to take down Lambert, just ask.
只要你有空了，可以随时来找我！
Skipping Tamarind cutscene.
跳过塔玛琳的开篇剧情。
Morning, \PN, I'm <imp>Professor Tamarind</imp>.
早上好\PN，\n我是<imp>塔玛琳博士</imp>。
I'd say "welcome to Makya!", but that's not really why you're here.
毕竟你不是来这里旅游的，\n我就不说什么“欢迎来到马凯亚”了。
C'mon. Let's get you set up.
时间宝贵，跟我来吧。
Looks like we’re both moving on. Don’t worry, I’m not coming with you.
是时候出发了，\n放心，我不会跟着你的。
But, uh, there’s something I kinda forgot to fill you in on.
不过还有件事忘了告诉你。
Do you know about <imp>Team Chasm</imp>?
你知道<imp>裂隙队</imp>吗？
So, Team Chasm used to run this place. All of it -- the whole region.
裂隙队是这里曾经的管理者，\n我说的不只是这座岛，\n而是整个马凯亚地区。
They turned Makya from wilderness to a real region over the past twenty years.
他们用了二十年的时间，\n将马凯亚从一片荒野，\n发展成如今的模样。
Then, well, you know how it goes.
然后...嗯...就在八年前...
Some kid trainer decides to go on a rampage and takes the whole organization down.
一些年轻的训练家联合起来，\n将整个组织给搞垮了，
That was eight years ago.
这事闹得蛮大的。
But, uh, those people didn’t just disappear. Half the people you meet are gonna be ex-members.
我说这些是想告诉你，\n就算组织已经解散了，\n曾经的成员也不会就此消失。
Even more than that in the regional administration. They’re chill, but just… it’s better to know.
你在这里遇到的人，\n起码有一半都曾是裂隙队的一员，\n他们依然掌握着资源与权力...\n言尽于此。
Oh, so you did your research? Great. Spares me the effort.
哦？看来你做过功课了？\n也好，省得我浪费口舌。
Anyways.
总之，
I know you only care about being Champion and impressing Mommy.
我知道你只在意你妈妈的看法，\n以及如何成为这里的冠军，
But between the avatars and, uh, other issues, I’ve got problems that need taking care of.
但是很多问题是你绕不开的，\n比如“化身”什么的...
You’re talented and I can make it worth your while.
反正总会遇上，\n不妨顺便帮我解决一些麻烦，
Speaking of which, despite my spiel about being even with mommy dearest, here.
都说到这里了...虽然我说是\n跟你最亲爱的妈妈扯平了...
Mavis had LuxTech’s R&D assist with making these things back when… well, let’s not get into that.
但梅维斯当时让光华制作的\n那些东西，当时...\n算了，不提那些陈芝麻烂谷子了。
I have extras around now that the original users are... otherwise employed... and so I figure you might as well get one.
总之，我现在多出一个来，\n因为它之前的主人...\n另谋高就了...我觉得你用得上。
It’s a way to <imp>read up on an opponent’s team</imp> before trying to take them on.
这是一个能<imp>在战斗之前\n得知对方队伍配置</imp>的道具。
Please do not ask me why it’s called the Poké X-Ray. It doesn’t even use x-rays.
不要问我为什么叫它“宝可检测”，\n反正这名字不是我取的。
I – you know what, just don’t ask questions and appreciate the damn thing.
我...总之，你就别问东问西了，\n好好利用这鬼东西吧。
The point is, in the future, maybe you help me out and I keep giving you free stuff, OK?
重点是，如果你之后帮到我的忙，\n我也不介意给你些好东西，懂了？
Well, keep it in mind.
当然，这不是要求，是交易。
See ya, kid.
再见了，小孩儿。
Casaba Villa Gym
甜瓜道馆
Leader: Lambert
馆主：兰伯特
Fighting dirty for over a decade.
数十年如一日，以肮脏形态出击。
Hey!
嘿
I'm bored and want to have fun. Let's play hide and seek!
太无聊了，来跟我捉迷藏吧！
I took some TMs from my Pa when he wasn't looking.
我趁爸爸不注意拿了一些技能机，
If you can find me, I'll give the TMs to you.
只要你能找到我，\n它们就是你的了。
I'll be somewhere on the route to the foreclosed tunnel. Smell ya later!
我会藏在城镇北边的某个地方，\n快来找我吧！
Closed while Lambert participates in the Makya Championship Tournament.
马凯亚竞技大会期间暂时闭馆。
Be careful outside the Villa, you don't want to end up as another incident in the newspapers.
在镇子外要小心一些，\n你也不想成为报纸头条上的受害者吧？
No, I'm not talking about wild Pokemon.
并不是说那些野生宝可梦有多危险，
Haven't you heard about the... "avatars" I think they were calling them?
难道你没听说过...\n他们好像管它们叫“化身”来着？
It's seemed like all anyone has wanted to talk about for 3 months!
最近三个月大家都在谈论它们！
I for one can't wait for the whole thing to blow over, so I can read again about things of real interest.
希望这热度赶紧消退吧，\n我更想在报纸上看些有用的东西。
Like the stock market.
比如说股市预测什么的。
Hey, \PN. I heard you beat Lambert.
嘿，\PN，你已经打赢兰伯特了？
Guessing you’re gonna head for the <imp>mainland</imp> now?
是前往<imp>大陆</imp>的时候了对吧？
Well, before you go, meet me at the dock, 'kay?
走之前先来码头见一面怎么样？
Got something to say. Thanks.
我有事跟你说。
She hung up...
挂断了……
Lambert has some interesting choices of Pokemon.
兰伯特有一些很有趣的宝可梦。
His prized Riolu was a gift from Victoire, another gym leader. Sangfroid, he calls her.
比如说另一位道馆馆主\n维克托送给他的那只利欧路，\n它的名字是“静静”。
A beautiful name, in my opinion!
真是个可爱的名字啊！
I believe Lambert also has a Croagunk. Or.... two of them?
除此之外，兰伯特还有一只...\n或者说两只不良蛙？
I'm not sure, but I swear I saw a sparring match, where the two seemed identical...
谁知道呢，反正我是看到过\n他拿出两只不良蛙的比赛…
That was a fun game of hide and seek!
真好玩，真好玩！
I've learned that if I offer stolen goods to people, they'll let me do whatever I want!
我明白了，\n只要把偷来的东西作为奖励，\n就能让别人听我的！
You keen to take me up on my offer?
要来一场对决吗？
Understood.
我知道了。
I'll be here until you wish to battle.
我会在这里等你的。
Nice. Let's get into it.
很好，那就开始吧！
Well fought!
打得不错！
As promised, despite your overwhelming victory, I remain enthusiastic to try again.
不过就算你取得了完胜，\n我依然想再试一次。
Well, still some kinks to work out, it seems.
很棒，不过还有进步空间。
Heal up, and return to me at your leisure.
帮你的宝可梦恢复后再来吧。
As a fellow competitor, I have nothing to say but to congratulate you on your victory over Lambert.
作为竞争对手，\n我只能祝贺你战胜兰伯特。
I'll take this as the cue to go make my attempt as well. Wish me luck!
我也会以此为契机，\n继续加油的！
You haven't completed what you need to on the island yet!
先处理完\n这座岛上的事情再出发吧！
Would you like to leave Casaba Villa and go to the Mainland?
要离开甜瓜岛前往大陆吗？
Oh, you just got a MasterDex? They're pretty neat.
哦，你拿到大师图鉴了？
Of all its features, the DexNav is my favorite.
我最喜欢的是“图鉴导引”系统！
It's a really fun way to see what Pokemon you still have to catch in a new area.
我们可以利用这个系统，\n看到当前区域还没有抓到的宝可梦。
Once you've caught one, you can also use it to find more of that same species!
而且还能帮助我们捕捉更多\n已经抓过的宝可梦！
Isn't technology amazing?
这就是科技的力量！
As a fisher, you learn to pick up on small inconsistencies around you.
作为一名合格的钓鱼佬，\n必须要着重锻炼自己的观察力。
Take for example that bush behind me. I bet something's going on with it.
就比如说后面那个草丛，\n我一眼就看出它不对劲！
Would you look at that! Found yourself something nice.
看吧！你找到东西了！
Keep an eye out for those sort of things. Don't be afraid to poke around a bit.
所以要学会眼观六路耳听八方，\n不要嫌累，嫌麻烦。
You never know what you might find...
谁知道下一次会找到些什么...
Lambert, the gym leader, came running through here earlier.
兰伯特馆主刚刚去西边了，
He put a rock behind him to block it off, for some reason.
而且还故意用石头堵住了路...\n谁知道他到底怎么想的。
You need to get through?
你要去海滩那边？
Well...there's an abandoned tunnel up to the north.
嗯...北边有一个废弃的隧道，
You can probably find something to blow this rock up if you go there.
那里或许能找到一些\n可以炸开这块石头的东西。
Oh hey, you cleared out that rock!
哦，你把石头处理掉了！
Who knew explosives could be so useful?
这炸药竟然这么猛？
Oh, so it is you!
哦，你来了！
Forgive my doppelganger – a Ditto that stalks me incessantly, claiming to be the real deal.
还请你原谅另一个我\n -- 那只是一只有些调皮的，\n试图冒充我的百变怪而已。
I had a dream that I would find someone here, and here you are!
我曾多次梦到在这里与某人的相会，\n而现在，你出现了！
May I read your palm?
我可以看看你的手相吗？
Oh? Afraid I may hex you?
嗯？你怕我诅咒你？
Rest assured, gramarye isn’t my forte.
放心，我是占卜师，不是巫师。
Very well.
好吧...
At least take this. It’s designed to ward off evil.
这个给你了，它有一定的驱邪功能。
Many thanks.
哼哼。
Now, let me see... yes, of course.
让我看看...没错，千真万确！
You are the shuttle of fate’s weave. Undoubtedly who I have awaited.
你就是命运之梭的执掌者，\n是那个我一直在等待的人。
Your future is fraught with danger, of course, so I made this to ward off evil influences. Please, take it.
你的前路充满了艰难险阻，\n所以我为你准备了这个，\n它或许能帮你渡过难关。
Well, I think my stalker and I shall be off now.
现在我要跟她离开了，
She wishes to visit some <imp>ice cave</imp> or another to prove a point.
她貌似想去<imp>冰之洞窟</imp>看看，
I dare not leave her alone, claiming to be me, so off I go!
我不可能放任另一个自己在外游荡，\n所以我必须跟上去！
Fare you well, traveler!
最后祝你好运，旅行者！
We'll see.
走着瞧
...
...
Oh, shut up.
闭嘴！
Sure.
需要
I don't need your help.
谁需要你帮忙？
No
等下
Yes
走
Maybe later.
稍等一会儿
Sure, let's go.
来吧
No way.
没门
[Map137]
I'm a safety minded person.
我是一个很注重安全的人。
For that reason, I wear a Hi-Vis Jacket with me wherever I go.
因此，我无论走到哪里\n都会带着一件显眼的夹克。
Everything's changed now that Avatars are around.
但现在有了化身这个威胁...
I'm worried they'll be drawn to me by the reflections.
我很担心他们会被\n这件夹克的反射吸引过来。
If you're going out and fighting those things, maybe that's somehow an upside for you...?
如果你想主动跟那些东西战斗，\n这或许会是一种帮助？
I'll need to check Eleig.com for any new safety products that will work on Avatars.
我得去网店上看看，\n有没有什么针对化身的安全装置。
[Map138]
The berry plant is growing.
树果还在生长中。
I caught this Pichu in the really tall grass!
我在那片高草丛中抓到了这只皮丘！
Oh, didn't you know?
嗯？你还不知道？
The Pokémon that live there don't live in the other grass!
那边生活着跟普通草丛里\n完全不同的宝可梦！
Even my new Pokémon couldn't cut it...
即便有了新宝可梦还是赢不了...
Hmm, we'll see how they do on another try.
嗯，我们回头再试一次吧。
I wonder if there's good things to catch in the Cave up to the North...
不知道北边的洞窟里\n会不会有更好的宝可梦可以捉...
Oh, er, you look like you want to battle.
呃...你想跟我对战？
I'm not a Trainer. You can tell by the fact that I don't have a <imp>follower Pokemon</imp>.
我不是训练家，\n我身边并没有<imp>宝可梦跟随着</imp>。
Dunno if you're new here or something, but Trainers in Makya will usually have a Pokemon by their side if they're looking to battle.
不知道你是不是刚来马凯亚，\n在这里，那些想要战斗的训练家，\n都会将自己的一只宝可梦带在身边。
Cuts all the awkward confusion with the eye contact stuff.
这样可以避免尴尬的眼神交流。
Anyways, now for the real reason I'm here.
至于我为什么会在这里...
Name's Jovan. I'm with Research and Development at Sweetrock Candy Company.
我叫约凡，\n是蜜岩糖果公司的研发人员。
I need test subjects. Since you're a licensed trainer, you can help me out. Take this.
我正在寻找合法的训练家\n帮我测试新的产品，\n如果你愿意帮忙，请带上这个。
Once you train your Pokemon enough, this thing will start popping out candies.
当你的宝可梦到达极限后，\n这个装置就会产生经验糖果。
Have your Pokemon eat them. It'll let them grow stronger.
喂给那些还不够强的宝可梦，\n就能让它们快速形成战力。
Since you're such a good sport about it, I have another treat for you if you find me on the mainland.
很高兴你愿意帮助我，\n回头再见面的话我请你吃饭。

Shiny Pokemon!
异色宝可梦！
My life has been spent in pursuit of these Pokemon, the most unique of all!
它们是我这一生的追求，\n是最为特别的存在！
Years ago I caught wind of a unique substance called Gleam Powder, that can only be found here in Makya.
几年前，我听说马凯亚这里\n有一种叫说闪亮粉末的东西。
Shiny Pokemon are hyper rare, but a little bit of Gleam Powder will attract them to you like magic.
这种粉末能像魔法一样，\n吸引到那些异色的宝可梦。
My artist's instincts drew me to another use: Turning boring standard Pokemon into Shinies!
但作为一名艺术家，\n我想到了另一种用法，\n那就是把普通宝可梦变成异色！
If you can find some of that mystical Gleam Powder, it'd be my pleasure to paint one of your Pokemon into a glamorous shiny.
如果你能找到一些闪亮粉末，\n我很乐意将你的宝可梦，\n变成更为迷人的异色形态。
I will have to charge, though. $30,000.
不过，是收费的，$30,000一次。
So, do you have any Gleam Powder? ...and the $30k?
你有闪亮粉末吗？\n并且有$30,000吗？
Oh, how boring it is to live a life without shinies.
唉，没有异色的生活多么无聊啊。

Seeking truth, as ever.
我还在寻找真相。
I cannot tolerate introspection, so extrospection will have to suffice.
我不擅长闷头去想，\n所以打算通过外界来引导。
The real one! The one that snaps at you if you say something so uncouth.
真的那个！\n如果你说了不礼貌的话，\n会咬你的那个！
The fake Imogene tries to ingratiate herself through saccharine kindness. Such as that amulet.
假的伊莫珍会试着通过\n过分的友好来讨好你，\n比如那个护身符。
Ah! Assist me – tolerate me – a while longer, would you?
啊！请帮帮我...\n再容忍我...一会儿，好吗？
You’re already in my grasp, and I am not afraid to bribe you to keep you there. I come bearing gifts, you see.
我已经知道怎么跟你相处了，\n你看，我带了礼物，\n靠这个应该可以吧？
But, to reach something resembling a point, I am here to reach a revelation.
不过，为了达到某种效果，\n我还在等待一个启示。
Look at this city: a sprawling blight. How many habitats, nests, spawning grounds were all stamped out for this?
看看这座城市：一个蔓延的瘟疫。\n为了建造它，有多少巢穴、\n栖息地都被摧毁了？
A concrete atrocity, paving over the world.
这种铺设在世界上的\n混凝土暴行...
…Perhaps. Pokémon have made their warrens here, too.
…或许，这里的地下，\n也有宝可梦创建了自己的家园。
The old died out that the new might live. Not so much erasure, then, but rather…
旧的消失了，新的得以诞生，\n所以这不是抹除，而是...
Indeed they do. Life has not been extinguished like a match ground underfoot. It has simply undergone a…
的确，生命并没有\n像是被踩灭的火柴一样消失，\n而是经历了一种...
I lived a great many years in a single-story nest of wood. It was comfortable enough.
我曾经在一座单层的\n木制巢穴中生活了很多年，\n那里还算舒适。
And yet everywhere I wander I find more wilderness gone. A creeping…
然而，无论我走到哪里，\n都会发现越来越多的生机消失。\n逐渐被…
Agree with what?
同意什么？
With me? I am not so sure I agree with myself. After all, life thrives here, albeit in different forms.
同意我的想法吗？\n我自己都不知道自己是不是对的。\n毕竟这里也有生命在茁壮成长，\n尽管其形式并不相同。
Evolution? Devolution? Certainly a…
是进化，退化？\n还是说…
Transformation.
转化。
And so I find myself here. The wild and untamed has shapeshifted into humanity.
所以我发现自己出现在这里，\n曾经的原野也变成了人类的巢穴。
That is what a city is, yes? The human biome?
或者说城市，对吗？\n这是人类的生物群系？
So what can I learn from all this? Is this what I am? An expression of humanity? Or is this a fake, too? With the untamed merely putting on a charade?
那么我能从中学到什么呢？\n这是我，还是人类的体现？\n还是说只是一个假象？\n只是原野在装模作样？
Do you believe I’m the real one?
你相信我是真的吗？
Thank you. I merely wish to prove it to her.
谢谢，我只是想向她证明这一点。
It would be a mercy, really – she is living a lie, quite literally. She deserves to be true to herself.
这其实也算一种仁慈...\n她一直活在一个谎言中，\n她应该对自己更真实些。
Hmph.
哼。
I suppose I can’t blame you. My assumption that my counterpart is a Ditto is founded purely on it being the only explanation.
我想我也没办法怪你，\n毕竟我的存在对应着百变怪，\n你最开始得到的就是这个解释。
Hardly convincing, but I know I am real, and therefore she cannot be.
我知道很难让人相信，\n但我自己清楚自己是真实的，\n那么她就不可能是真实的。
…Ah.
…啊。
I suggest you simply make up your mind, one way or another. In indecision lies madness.
我建议你还是做出一个要么是，\n要么否的判断，\n犹豫不决只会让你走向疯狂。
In truth… sometimes I doubt myself.
其实…有时我也会怀疑自己。
I remember being a child. I remember living years under my old home.
我记得小时候的生活，\n记得在老家度过的岁月。
And yet, I cannot remember when she began following me. No more than I can remember being born.
但是，我却记不起\n她是何时开始跟着我的，\n也不记得自己是何时出生的了。
Does that make me…
这让我…
But nevermind that. I have a gift.
不过，这不重要。\n我有一份给你的礼物。
Something destroyed by its transformation. And yet, it has found strength in that.
它经历了毁灭和转变，\n但在其中找到了力量。
I am unsure of what that may imply about my situation, and so I pass it on to you.
我不确定这是否与我的处境相关，\n所以我决定把它交给你。
Imogene passes you a Poké Ball. Inside is a Galarian Corsola. It seems happy to see you… as much as it can seem happy.
伊莫珍将一个宝可梦球递给你，\n里面是一只伽勒尔太阳珊瑚。\n它似乎很高兴见到你…\n尽管表情不太明显。
Another arrow in your quiver. Or perhaps another companion for the long road ahead.
这是你旅途中的又一件武器，\n或者是又一位伙伴。
In either case, may it prosper under your care.
无论哪种情况，\n都希望它在你的照顾下茁壮成长。
So long, traveler. I will head south, to home. You’re a welcome guest if ever you should arrive.
旅途愉快，\n我要往南走，回家去了。\n如果有机会，欢迎你来做客。
Oh? Very well.
哦？好吧。
If you find it unsuitable or untenable to take it, I will find someone else. Perhaps the local Pokécenter will take it in the interim.
如果你觉得不适合\n或者无法照顾它，\n我会找其他人来接手。\n也许当地的宝可中心可以。
In any case, I take my leave.
无论如何，我先告辞了。
I will head south, to home. You’re a welcome guest if ever you should arrive. So long, traveler.

But it turns out they’ve got, like, industrial amounts of stones in town. So I liberated a few extras.
他们把几乎所有进化石...\n大概...都集中到这座城市里了，\n所以我解放了其中一部分。

Surprise! I’m here, in the city I said I would be in.

Fight me.

I spend MONTHS out here, grinding my ass off to get this far, and you traipse in like it’s nothing.
我在这里花了几个月的时间，\n拼上命才走到这一步，\n而你却像郊游一样就跟了上来。
Why are you better? Why are you always better?
为什么你比我更好？\n为什么你总是比我更好？
Fine! I guess I’ll see you in the championship.
行吧，就这样吧。\n我们竞技大会上再见。
Watch your back out there, though.
不要以为这就完了。
I will get better, and then I’m going to find you.
我会变得更强，\n然后来找你！
Zain ever so graciously spared supplies from his Aid Kit...

C’mon. One more bout.
那就再来一场。
You’re joking.
你说什么？
You’re not even going to try?
你...试都不想试？
I can’t believe you’d even consider it.
我就说，你怎么会那样想。
You -- I can’t believe it.
你...简直不可理喻！
You really are an asshole, aren’t you?
你这个混蛋！
You just want an opportunity to be smugly superior, like you always have.
你一直都表现得好像高别人一等，\n一直以来都是这样！

Please, you have lived with us for generations!

Oh well! Can't save 'em all... just uhh... enjoy it while it lasts? Haha...

Anyways! We have a healing center! I'm a qualified nurse, actually! Just don't have the typical uniform.

总之，如果你需要我的帮助，\n那就到后面的房子里找我，\n祝你在这里玩得开心...\n另外，多和当地人聊聊天吧！
Leave us to our ways, Trainer.
别管我们了，训练家。
You had to meddle. We have lost our traditions because of you!
就是你们在多管闲事，\n因为你们，我们失去了传统！
Ah, a visitor. It is rare to see one nowadays. I can hardly remember the last one's face.
啊，有一位访客！\n已经很久没人来这里了，\n我都快想不起上一个访客的样子了。
It's a shame. Memory is the only thing we have, and the only tool we can work with.
真遗憾...\n记忆是我们唯一拥有的东西，\n也是我们唯一可利用的工具。
Tell me Trainer, what is your greatest memory?
训练家，你最美好的回忆是什么？
A mighty accomplishment indeed. I wonder, will it be your favorite when you lose the title?
这的确是一项了不起的成就，\n我想知道，当你失去冠军头衔后，\n你最喜欢的还会是它吗？
You possess a full heart, Trainer. I wonder, will it be your favorite after you have seen them for the last time?
你有一颗饱满的心，训练家。\n我想知道，当你最后一次\n与他们相见后，你最珍视的记忆，\n还会是这一部分吗？
A feat of courage, and a show of strength! I wonder, will it be your favorite when your anger cools?
这是勇气与力量的展示！\n我想知道，当你的怒火平息，\n最怀念的还是这一部分吗？
It is wise to look forward. I wonder, will it be your favorite when you only have the future?
展望未来是明智之举，\n但我想知道，如果只有未来，\n那它还会是你的最爱吗？
This island, our home, will soon be nothing but a memory. What an awful fate.
这座小岛是我们的家园，\n但它很快就会成为回忆，\n这是多么可怕的命运。
There is nothing that can be done other than making one last memory.
除了留下最后的记忆外，\n我们别无他法。
A final hurrah before the shore closes in. A battle to shatter this island's very roots.
在海岸逼近之前最后的狂欢，\n一场足以摧毁岛屿根基的战斗。
Are you ready, Trainer, to battle?
你准备好了吗，训练家？
There are memories to be made, Trainer. Do not leave me apathetic.
我们都有美好的回忆，训练家，\n不要让我对此感到遗憾。
A disappointment, to say the least.
最终，还是失望。
If there is one think I know though, it is that minds can change. Change mine.
我明白，思想是可以改变的，\n或许我应该改变自己的想法。
Very well, I shall be here, looking for another memory.
好的，我就在这里，\n等待着下一段回忆。
I suppose that's that then. A final memory.
我想就这样吧...最后的记忆。
It was not unpleasent, Trainer. It was the best we could do in such a short time.
这算不上愉快，训练家。\n但这么短的时间，也只能如此了。
If you would like, this is our farewell. Soon, we will fade into each other's memory. Some time after, we will fade even further than that.
如果你愿意，这将是我们的告别，\n很快，我们就会淡出彼此的记忆，\n再过一段时间或许会完全消失。
But perhaps, there is something more. I must gather myself inside my little cove. You are free to follow.
但是，或许还有更多东西...\n可以藏在我自己的小海湾里，\n你请便。
I cannot let this happen!
我不会让这一切发生！
There is nothing left for us to do...
我们已经无计可施了...
I ache Trainer! There is hole in one's self when they lose their home, it is a heart torn in two!
我好难过，训练家！\n当一个人失去家园时，\n他的内心就会被空洞撕成两半！
The past has always been outside of our reach. And yet, when you cannot see it, it feels even further.
过去总在我们的视野之外，\n越是看不到它，\n越能感觉到它的遥远。
And yet, I do not feel despair. I feel bittersweet. When I think of home, it is impossible to not feel a little bit of warmth inside.
但我并不会对此感到绝望，\n我只会同时感觉到痛苦与快乐。\n每次想到家园，\n内心都能感受到一丝温暖。
Have you felt that conflict before, Trainer? A feeling of warmth and joy that lives within sorrow?
你感受过这样的冲突吗，训练家？\n那种悲伤中掺杂着\n温暖和喜悦的感觉？
I know your pain, Trainer.
我能明白你的痛，训练家。
The world is never the same after someone leaves, but we are always glad that we got to live in that world.
当某个人离开后，\n世界也不再是之前的那个了，\n但我们总会庆幸自己\n曾经生活在那个世界当中。
We think of the time spent with them, doing nothing. We regret it. Yet, that time is where they became who they are to us.
想起和他们一起的无所事事的时光，\n会让我们感到遗憾，\n但也正因为他们，\n我们才会成为今天的自己。
One day, maybe, we can forgive ourselves.
也许有一天，我们可以原谅自己。
They never look at us the same afterwards.
在那之后，\n他们看我们的目光就不一样了
You realize you cannot imagine them without thinking about how their expression changed when they learned of your failure.
我们会意识到，\n自己无法想象他们在得知\n我们的失败之后，\n表情会发生怎样的变化。
Sometimes, it is a necessary mistake to make. There is no growth if we let ourselves simmer.
有时，这是必然的错误，\n如果任由自己沉沦，\n就不会有所成长。
Then you are blessed now and cursed to feel it.
所以，你很幸运，\n能感受到它的诅咒。
But that is life, young one. You must realize that, as we love to say, it is what it is.
但这就是生活，年轻人，\n你必须一点点去理解事情的全貌。
I am filled with sorrow. It is the price I pay for joy.
我虽然心中充满悲伤，\n但这是我为快乐付出的代价。
But I am not helpless. I choose to pay again and again. Each time it worth it.
不过我并非束手无策，\n我每次选择的付出都是值得的。
Now, Trainer, will you show me a little bit of the joy you feel in battle?
现在，训练家，\n你能向我展示下战斗中的快乐吗？
There is no joy in battle without the bitterness of frustration. Let us pay your dues to our wiles.
没有挫折的苦涩，\n就没有胜利的喜悦，\n让我们用诡计来偿还你的代价吧。
Ahah! Take that!
哈哈，接招吧！
A-hem, I mean, frustration is a natural part of growth. Grow, and approach me again, Trainer.
我觉得，挫折是成长的自然过程，\n成长过后再来找我吧，训练家。
Afriad? Or cautious? Ah, well, it doesn't matter.
是害怕，还是谨慎？\n好吧，无所谓了。
I will be here. We all smile eventually.
我会在这里，我们都会得到微笑。
Perhaps you have caught a glimpse of that feeling, Trainer.
或许你已经触及到这种感觉了，\n训练家。
It matters not, you will feel it soon enough. It will feel wonderful and awful and all of those great things.
没关系，很快你就能感受到，\n那些让你觉得美妙与可怕的事物，\n以及它们所蕴含的美好。
I will collect my feelings before I leave. I'll be inside.
我会收拾好心情再进去，\n等待离开的那一刻。
If you would like to follow, you are more than free.
如果你想跟上来，\n我也不会阻拦你。
A guest! What a pleasant surprise!
有客人！真是惊喜！
Have you come to challenge me? I have a bit of time to test my mettle.
你是来挑战我的吗？\n我也的确有些时间\n来检验一下自己的实力。
Ah, but before we get too far ahead of myself, I must sate my curiosity.
啊，不过在这之前，\n先满足一下我的好奇心吧。
You seem no stranger to struggle, but tell me, have you ever been broken by challenge?
看起来你应该很熟悉对战吧，\n那你曾经被打垮过吗？
Utterly shattered. Reduced. Something you viewed as damningly insurmountable?
就是被彻底打败...那种事，\n或者说你觉得无法克服的事情？
Hmm, bold. It is one thing to break yourself for another. It is another for them to mock your pieces.
嗯，很大胆。\n为他人牺牲是一回事，\n被别人嘲笑不值又是另一回事。
It can be a moment that defines your world, and you are not in control of it.
这或许是一个你可以决定自己\n生活在一个什么样的世界的时刻，\n但你并不能掌控它。
And you certainly you gained something in the end! Of course, you know as well as any that the real danger lies afterwards.
当然，你肯定会有所收获！\n而且你也应该清楚，\n真正的危险，还在那之后。
It is one thing to climb a mountain once. It is another to climb a hill each day.
爬山是一回事，\n但每天怕啥就是另一回事了。
If honesty were a virtue, you'd qualify as a saint.
如果诚实是一种美德，\n那你就可以被称为标杆了。
Not that it's a good thing.
当然这也不一定是好事。
Then there is something you must do, now! There is a wide open world out there, but you must be torn down for a new life to grow!
那现在，有件你必须要做的事情，\n那就是铲掉眼前的这个广阔世界，\n并让新的生命再次生长！
But I digress. The force of will takes man and mon far, but it cannot always overcome cold reality.
抱歉，我跑题了，\n意志，能使人走得更远，\n但它不是一定能战胜冷酷的现实。
This island will be gone. There are some that refute that.
这座小岛马上就不复存在，\n但有些人却对此反驳。
Sometimes, there is value in fighting the inevitable. Sometimes. I am never sure about it until it is over.
有时，与不可避免之祸斗争，\n会付出难以想象的代价。\n有时，在事情结束之前，\n谁也不知道是否还有转机。
There are those who try to preserve this place, as foolish as that might be.
有些人在试图保护这个地方，\n虽看看起来感觉很愚蠢。
I wonder how it will end up for them. It is a good trial, and a proper funeral.
虽然不知道他们的结局会如何，\n但这是一次合适的审判，\n也是一场体面的葬礼。
But that is them. I should focus on myself. I am ready for challenge. Are you ready for battle, Trainer?
但那是他们的事。\n现在我们该关注自己，\n我已经准备好接受挑战了，\n你准备好了吗，训练家？
Excellent!
很好！
Now is the time! Let us break and reform from our struggles!
现在正是时候！\n让我们从纠结中挣脱出来吧！
And you lay before me in pieces.
你在我面前支离破碎了。
There's only one direction to go from here. Regain youself, and try again. You can do better.
从这里开始，只有一个方向，\n重新找回自己，再试一次，\n你可以做得更好。
Very well, but do not leave me waiting. I abhor idleness.
很好，但别让我等太久，\n我讨厌无所事事。
I am looking for one last trail myself. Are you ready for battle, Trainer?
我在寻找最后的踪迹，\n准备好了吗，训练家？
Wonderful! It was about time for me to shatter!
太棒了，是时候让我崩溃了！
I revel in that sting you get when you know you've been outmatched! It is undeniable, how jealous I am!
我陶醉于那种不敌对手的刺痛感，\n不可否认，我甚至有些嫉妒你！
But such a feeling is fleeting, for better and for worse.
但这种感觉无论好坏，稍纵即逝。
It's time for me to get ready for the next hill. I'll be inside if you need me.
我该为下一座山做准备了，\n如果你需要，我就在里面。
These Guardians have been here since before all of us.
这些守护者在我们来此生活之前，\n就已经在这座岛上了。
If there is a way forward, they will bring us there.
如果有出路，它们会拯救我们。
You have snuffed out any hope that we had.
你掐灭了我们的希望。
I'm not sure that it was a good or bad deed.
我不知道这到底算什么。
We seek its power to heal our home.
我们寻求它治愈家园的力量。
You must have a plan!
你必须得有个计划！
Centuries of guidance cannot end like this!
几个世纪的传承不能就这样结束！
So many here wish to give up our homeland. To what! Simple time and happenstance?
这里很多人都希望我们放弃家园，\n为什么？只是因为时间和偶然？
I will depart, but I will be bitter. The spirit of our island will sink with it.
如果我离开，就会感到痛苦，\n我们的精神也会随着岛屿而沉没。
I am surrounded by fools! The sages are right! We must adapt or perish!
周围这些人都是傻子，\先知是对的，我们要适应它，\n不然终将会灭亡！
Leave me be, outsider.
别来管我，外乡人。
My Rampardos and I have a unique camaraderie. We suffer from hair loss.
我和我的战槌龙们\n有一种独特的友谊，\n我们都有脱发问题。
I need to get a sick crown like my Rampardos...
我需要一个战槌龙那样的头盖...
I must treat the little hair I have left kindly.
必须善待我所剩无几的头发。
Mmm. Maybe I should buy a hat.
嗯...或许我该买顶帽子。
Hon hon! This island has exceptional beauty! It is a shame I will be the last visitor to see it.
吼吼，这座岛真漂亮啊！\n很遗憾，我将是最后一个\n看到它的游客了。
Oh, are you also foreign to here? Well, that ruins the title of "last visitor".
哦？你也是外乡人啊？\n好吧，这下“最后的游客”\n就不是我了。
Ah, the locals here are so good at battling.
啊，这里的人真擅长对战。
I think I'll enjoy a fine Kalosian wine...
有点想念我们卡洛斯的美酒了...
Look towards the future, Trainer. You might miss how much of a mess the past becomes.
展望未来吧，训练家，\n即便再怎么怀念混乱的过去。
Come, my Pokemon. Let us take a final stroll.
来吧，我的宝可梦，\n让我们最后再散散步吧。
It's a shame how the past has been tainted.
真遗憾，过去的一切都被玷污了。
We are old minded here. But our ways are nothing in front of nature.
这里的人们思想守旧，\n但在大自然面前，什么也不是。
We like to forget that we are still a part of nature, no matter how high we build ourselves.
我们喜欢忘记那些，\n无论将房子修建得有多高，\n我们仍是大自然的一部分。

I mean, I don’t speak their language but – I’m sorry, I can’t explain very well.

I only speak well… I only speak dueling. And you speak it too.
我只会说“好的”…\n还有那些决斗用语，\n这些你也能说。
Oh.
哦…
I guess that’s – I mean, that’s my life. First the arm, and then the shyness, and then suddenly you’re a thirteen-year-old hero and – oh. I’m so, so sorry.
我想这就是我的生活吧。\n先是胳膊，然后是性格问题…\n之后突然在十三岁就成了英雄，\n然后…哦...我非常的抱歉。

\PN, meet Yezera, former Champion. Yezera, meet \PN, future Champion.

Figures. You’re an explorer, and she keeps away from the beaten paths.
也对，\n你身上有探险家的潜质，\n而她又总是偏离大路。
Or any paths at all, honestly.
或者说她根本不走任何大路。

哦？这样看来上次见面后，
For both of you, now that I think about it.
你们两个都发生了很大的变化。
Now that’s just grand.
那真是太棒了！
What I wanted, honestly. I’ve basically been shipping you two – except, y’know, with violence instead of…
这就是我想达成的目的，\n我一直想让你们两个联系在一起，\n即便用一些暴力手段...
I should’ve left that thought in my head.
好吧…
Anyways…
我应该把那种想法深埋在脑海里。
Hah! So you’ve gotten the same treatment that we did.
哈！看样子你也遭到了\n跟我们的一样的待遇。
She’s good at what she does… and bad at what she doesn’t.

Even if you’d like me to.

Are you OK? I haven’t seen you in…
你还好吗？\n我们已经有一年多没见过面了...
Over a year. Two since we’ve talked.
两年了，\n从我们上次对话算起。
I’m – I’m fine but – I can’t. I can’t do this.
我…我没事，\n但是…我不能。\n我不能这样做…
Not with both of you – I’m sorry.
我不是不想和你们待在一起，\n我很抱歉。
Well… at least she’s alive and intact.
好吧...\n至少她还完好无损地活着。
Yezera. The girl that took down Team Chasm. First Champion of Makya.
叶泽拉，\n打败了裂隙队的女孩，\n也是马凯亚的第一位冠军。
Mystery disappearance, manhunt, no tracks, the works.
后来她神秘失踪了，\n我一直在找她，\n却没有任何线索。
She’s grown since then… but still a nervous wreck.
这两年她长大了...\n但还是那个容易紧张的姑娘。
Anyways. You didn’t come here for history.
哦对，哦对，\n你又不是来这里听历史课的。
I wouldn’t go that far.
我不想说太多。
It’s stupid, is what it was. The whole shebang.
整个计划，\n从头到尾都荒谬至极。
But, yeah, anyways. Gift.
回到正题，\n这是我给你准备的礼物。
Yeah, I’ve wasted enough of your time.
也对，我耽误了你太多时间。
That gift I mentioned – let’s get to that.
那现在让我们谈谈，\n关于电话里提到的礼物。
Indeed! I wanted to get you to meet her, but I know your type. I can bait a hook.
当然！\n我想让你和她见见面，\n所以就拿这个作为钓上你的鱼饵了。
Well, if you’re interested I can – actually, it’s probably better for you to hear it from her mouth. You’ll see her again.
好吧，如果你有兴趣，\n我可以让你…\n或许从她嘴里听到可能更好。\n你们肯定还会再见面的。
She wouldn’t let a potential challenger go.
她不会放过任何潜在的挑战者。
But!
但是现在，
Your gift.
这是给你准备的礼物。
Since avatars turned the bridge to flotsam – and, yes, I TOLD THEM to reinforce it!
尽管我告诉过他们要加固大桥，\n但化身还是把它\n变成了漂在河面上的碎块！
They didn’t, since they trust ex-Chasm about as far as they can throw them and – anyways!
那些家伙把我的话当成耳旁风，\n毕竟他们不愿意相信\n一个前裂隙队成员
For very stupid, avoidable reasons, the river’s basically uncrossable without Surf.
由于这些本可以避免的愚蠢错误，\n现在过河的方法只剩下冲浪了。
If you’re like me, you’re not gonna pack a Water-type everywhere you go, so just use this instead.
如果你和我一样，\n没有随身携带\n水属性宝可梦的习惯，\n那就用这个代替吧。
It’s just more practical. Stylish, too! Assuming you’re good at it. Which I’m not.
这真是时尚又实用的办法，\n当然前提是你别像我一样，\n不能熟练操纵它。
Go have fun and get those badges.
去享受赢得徽章的旅程吧。
Oh, and, uh, this is Helena’s place, so feel free to eat some of her food or something before you go.
哦，差点忘了说，\n这里是海伦娜的地盘，\n走之前可以随意吃点她的食物什么的。
Kick a vase over. Carve your name in the table. Er – maybe someone else’s name. Yezera’s name! She’d get a kick out of that. Heh.
打碎花瓶，并把名字刻在桌子上…\n或者刻上别人的名字也行。\n比如说叶泽拉！\n她会很高兴的，嘿嘿。

Oh, so it’s you again. You’ve arrived at a rather fortuitous time.
哦，又是你。\n你来得正是时候。
I’ve caught this pair of Makyan forms and would like some more data – but excuse me. Again, my manners.

Shall we get down to it?
我们开始吧？
Highly educational.

It would seem that both of them have been honed by their vendetta.
看起来它们两个\n都被仇恨磨练得更强了。
From what I’ve gleaned in local sources, the Sevipers became Steel-type to fend off Zangoose.
根据当地收集的信息来看，\n饭匙蛇为了抵抗天敌猫鼬斩\n演化出了钢属性。
They managed to drive the local Zangoose populations to extinction, yet even that didn’t stop the feud.
它们想方设法清除了这里的死敌，\n但这并没能让一切结束。
Fighting until they died, and then even beyond. The tenacity of the Zangoose is admirable, no?
猫鼬斩的韧性也令人钦佩，\n它们没有选择就此逃散，\n而是战斗到用尽最后一丝力气。
The Zangoose counter-adaptation – the Fighting-type – seems to be a product of their indestructible spirit.
正是在这样坚不可摧的信念支持下\n它们逐渐演化出了\n能反制仇敌的格斗属性。
Curious. Could these be the predators the Furrets adapted to beat?
不过这样的演化好像\n对被捕食的大尾立更有利？
No, the Psychic type would hurt as much as help.
也不对，超能属性会帮倒忙的。
A mystery for another time. I would like to thank you for your help, but actions speak louder than words.
这就是另一个\n需要时间验证的谜团了。\n我想比起口头感谢，\n你更喜欢这个。
Take this, from my homeland.
这是来自我故乡的礼物。
Goodbye. I can’t say where I’ll end up next.
再见。\n我不知道我下一站会去哪里。
Perhaps the <imp>sewers beneath Prizca</imp>. If any biome might cause new forms to emerge, it would be that.

大概...她必须坦白告诉我们\n她之前都做过些什么，\n然后我们就会把她绳之以法
...OK, to be, like, totally honest with you: I’m worried you’re gonna betray me.
...好吧，说实话，大概...\n我最担心的是...\n你不是站在我这边的。
Because she, like, did you a favor and you’re working with her and all that.
毕竟她帮过你的忙，\n你们还在一起工作什么的。
But you won’t. I mean, like, she caused all of this! This entire place is mega-screwed because of what she did!

呃，我不是那个意思。\n她比我大二十五岁。
I... \PN, I still really hate her. She is, like, the worst.
我…\PN，\n我还是很讨厌她。\n她就是...大概...最差劲的那个人。
She’s this snooty arrogant brat that literally destroys things that get in her way for no reason. But, like, I can’t just punch her and make it better.
她就是一个自大傲慢的娇娇女，\n没有任何理由地\n摧毁她前进的路上的一切。\n但只靠打她一顿...大概...\n并不能让一切变好
...But I did punch her.
...可我确实打了她。
Not really! It was kind of a wimpy punch. Still, I had to do it.
我没有下很重的手！\n只用了一种较为温和的手段，\n我必须这样做。
For baby Candy, at least.
至少为了将来的小糖儿...
I know, I know! It was stupid.

Oh, not even. She deserves to be punched, like, at least twice.
不，一点也不。\n她至少应该...大概...被打两次。
What? That punching her doesn’t make it better?
你想说什么？\n打她不会让事情变得更好吗？
Or that I, like, decked her in the first place? Because the answer is yeah, I’m a learning Candy.
或者说我打她...\n大概...是错的吗？\n恐怕是这样的，\n我现在只能算是个小号的经验糖...
Really, I let her off easy. But, um, I didn’t really let her off.
实际上，我反而给她减轻了压力。\n但是，嗯，\n我并没有真正原谅她。
I kinda... got hired? Like, I do not trust that hag for a second, so I’m gonna stick to her like a Remoraid.
这好像...让一切...\n变成我的职业了？大概...\n那个老太婆我一秒钟都不愿相信她\n所以我会像铁炮鱼一样附在她身上。
She’s gonna fix all the messed-up stuff that she and her cronies caused.
她需要弥补一切\n她和她的党羽造成的混乱。
And she’s, like, totally overworked, so, um... yeah. I’m her aide now!
而且她正在全力做这些，\n大概...所以，嗯...\n是的，我现在是她的助手。
And bodyguard. And conscience.
同时兼任保镖，\n还要作为她的良心去监督。
I get to get justice, and she gets to not have her labs be on fire. Everyone wins.

Who knows! Maybe I’ll think better of it tomorrow and firebomb her lab anyways!
管他呢！\n也许我明天会想明白一切，\n然后照例烧毁她的实验室！
Hey! What’s that supposed to mean?
嘿！那是什么意思？
Do you think I’m just, like, this belligerent ditzy manic Spritzee dream girl?
你认为我只是一个冒着傻气，\n好斗又易怒的粉香香吗？
No, but, yeah, I get it. I don’t know that I’m, like, super cut out for this either.
不，可是…\n没错，我明白。\n我也不清楚自己...大概...\n是否适合这个工作。
Um. I think, like, you can get fired for that? So... no?
嗯，我觉得，大概...\n这样做可能会被解雇吧？\n所以...不行？
Maybe. I’ll think about it.
谁知道呢，\n我会考虑一下。
Well, now if I want to steal someone’s Pokémon back I can just have Tamarind order it, so, like, I guess not?
的确，如果我现在\n还想要偷走别人的宝可梦，\n只要让塔玛琳下个命令就行了，\n所以我觉得没必要了吧？
I’m still gonna steal things. Let’s all be, like, honest for a second: I’m not changing my ways.
但我可不敢打包票，\n让我们都诚实一点：\n我不会改变我的作风。
But I am gonna be busier with other stuff now! So, yeah. There’s that.
但是我现在有其他更重要事情！\n这会消耗掉我多余的精力，\n大概...就这样。
Oh, by the way, Tamarind was all like:
哦，顺便说一下，\n塔玛琳刚才说：
“If you want proof that I’m doing my damnedest to help this region” and then she blabbered about like a secret lab and horrible monsters.
“如果你想要确定我正在\n尽自己所能帮助这个地区什么的”，\n然后她突然跑题唠叨起来，\n说了一些关于秘密实验室\n以及可怕的怪物的事情。
Y’know. Like, containing an extradimensional evil and all that. Anyways, she gave me this key, but I don’t really, like, care?
像是一个超维度的邪恶生物之类的，\n随后她给了我这个钥匙，\n但我不是很在意这些。
Like, sure, whatever, she did hard work. She wants to prove she’s good, she can put her money where her mouth is and prove it by working with me.
大概...当然，\n她也付出了很多努力，\n她如果想要证明自己，\n完全可以付诸行动，\n和我一起工作来证明自己。
Anyways, um… you can have it? Maybe cool stuff? Maybe extradimensional evil?
我只是...你可以拿走它吗？\n里面可能是很酷的东西？\n又或者是超维度的邪恶？
Um, anyways, yeah. I, um, yeah.
嗯，不管怎么说…\n我…我，我想说。
Thanks.
谢谢。
Thanks, like, a lot. You’re a good friend.
真的非常感谢，\n你是个真正的益友。
But, um, I think that’s it.
差不多就这样了。
I have to go with Tamarind now and make sure she doesn’t, like, kick a child or something on the way back to Prizca.
我现在必须和塔玛琳一起离开了，\n确保她不会在回宏礼市的路上\n踢路边熊孩子的屁股，\n或者做其他不怎么合适的举动。
So, this is goodbye. And, well, you know what that means.
所以，这就是告别了...\n你知道这意味着什么。
*sniff* Yeah... aww, \PN, we can’t be justice friends anymore.
*哭泣* 是啊...嗯…，\PN，\n我们不能再做正义之友了。
We’ll just be regular friends.
我们只能做普通的朋友了。
I’m gonna see you again, I know, but… we had like an arc together! We had an arc, and now it’s over. *sniff*
我知道我会再见到你的，\n但是...我们本应一起冒险的故事，\一起为了正义而奋斗的故事，\n现在要结束了。*哭泣*
Aww, don’t tempt me. But, um, I kinda had my Pokémon tussle with Tamarind back there and they need to rest for now.
哎呀，不要妄图诱惑我，\n我的宝可梦刚刚\n才和塔玛琳打了一架，\n它们现在需要休息。
Maybe someday? Jeanne wants to kick your ass.
也许有一天？我是说也许，\n让娜想狠狠地揍你一顿呢。
Like, not your Pokémon. You. Sorry! Watch your back out there, I guess.
大概...不是你的宝可梦，\n是你本人！\n对不起…在外面一定要注意安全。
Oh!
哦
Um, listen, you’re really cute but I’m not really... into you?
嗯，听着，\n虽然你真的很可爱，\n但我还没喜欢你到那种程度。
I’m, like, super into the sweep me off my feet romance story kinda thing?
我只是...大概...\n那种喜欢浪漫故事的人。
Like, theoretically if I needed to disguise myself while bad guys were searching and I had someone I could kiss to hide my face. Y’know. Cliche stuff.
大概...打个比方，\n如果我得在坏人追查时隐藏自己，\n我能做出亲吻某个陌生人\n来挡住我的脸之类的事情\n那种相当老套的情节。
But, um, I’m not, like, into actual relationships? If that makes sense?
但我不是真的喜欢恋爱关系，\n如果你能明白我的意思。
No! We, like, didn’t learn anything from this.
不！我们大概...的的确确，\n没有因此做出太多改变。
We un-learned things.
我们只是读懂了反面教材。
Listen, we are, like, the dumbest people alive.
或许，我们大概...\n就是世界上最蠢的人。
That’s why we’re obsessed with justice and, um, kinda impulsive!
这就是为什么我们\n一直醉心于所谓的正义…\n抱歉，有点冲动了。
Mainly me, but you too. I know it. We’re twinsies.
主要是我，但你也是，\n我知道，我们是彼此的镜子。
...I’m gonna miss the hell out of you.
...我会非常想念你的。
I know, I know! I’m not, like, going-going. But, like, it feels that way. And I miss you already. Hug?
我知道，我知道！\n这不是永别，这不是！\n但，感觉没什么差别...\n我已经开始想你了...\n我们能...抱一下吗？
Um... \PN? I’m, not, like, the healthiest person? Like, in the head.
嗯...\PN，\n我...大概...是不是...\n根本不是一个心理正常人？
I’ve done some pretty iffy stuff myself because I was, like, well, this is for justice.
因为自己觉得那样是正义\n就做出那些糟糕的事情…
Like that makes it OK.
谢谢，我好多了。
So, um, maybe working with Tamarind is a way for me to get justice for myself, too? And, yeah, I could probably use some therapy too.
所以，嗯，\n也许和塔玛琳一起工作\n是我寻求正义的另一种方式？\n可能我需要一些心理治疗。
And I understand if you don’t wanna be my friend after hearing that, but, um, I hope I see you again anyways. I’m gonna make things better.
如果你听完刚刚这些后\n不愿再跟我做朋友，\n我也能理解，但是，\n我还是希望能再见到你。\n我会拼尽全力让一切变得更好。
You go stop Yezera. Make sure all my hard work doesn’t get, like, undone, OK?
叶泽拉只能拜托你去阻止了，\n以确保我的辛劳不会白费，好吗？
Thank you, \PN. I… I gotta go. But I hope I see you again. Thanks for showing me what justice is.
谢谢你，\PN。\n我...我这次真得走了。\n我真的希望能再见到你。\n谢谢你让我懂得了什么才是正义。
...Ugh, that was cheesy. I, um, yeah. Love you. Toodles.
...啊，这太肉麻了。\n我…我…我…\n我喜欢你，拜拜。
You’re cool. You’re, like, my favorite person.
你是我见过最酷的人，\n你是我最喜欢的人。
I know you’ve still got, like, a lot of stuff to do, so go do it.
我知道你还有很多事情去做，\n我会永远为你加油。
I’ve got stuff to do, too. If Tamarind wasn’t waiting I’d, like, hug you for an hour.
现在我也有必须要做的事情了，\n如果不是塔玛琳在等我，\n我大概...会让你再抱我一个小时。
But, um, gotta go, I guess. You’re... we’ll see each other again? Right? Yeah. Of course we will.
但是，我真的真的得走了，\n你...我们会再见面对吧？\n一定会的。
I, um, yeah. Love you. Bye. Toodles!
我是不是啰嗦太多了...\n但我还是想最后再说一句，\n我喜欢你，再见！

Tsk. Maybe I'm just not cut out for this...
唉，或许我该回去了...
If you get your hands on an Fairy-type, I'd appreciate a trade.
如果你可以给我\n一只妖精属性的宝可梦，\n我会感激不尽。
Oh, you're a dear! Let's get this trade going.
你真好，我们交换吧！

The name on the mail box has worn away.

A shiny brass plaque reads "\PN's Residence".
一个闪闪发光的黄铜牌匾上写着\n "这是\PN的住址".
Y'know, \PN, I never thought to ask your name.
你知道吗，\PN，\n我之前从没想过要询问你的名字。
Figured it out on the way here when I did a quick li’l background check on my client up here, and then on you too.
但在来这里的路上，\n我对你，还有我的客户，\n进行了一次快速的背景调查，\n这才知道你叫什么。
Guess this breaks some kinda confidentiality rule, but I ain’t never been an honorable sort: it’s Zain.
虽然这会违反保密协定，\n但我从来都不在意这些，\n所以我打算告诉你，\n雇佣我训练宝可梦的人是赞恩。
Your big brother’s hired me, lookin’ to get his reserves in shape.
显然你哥哥为了更快获得 \n更多有战斗力的宝可梦，\n选择雇佣我来做这件事。
Keepin’ it cool. Gotta make sure it ain’t just bravado, though. Ya know how it is.
冷静冷静，我只是得确认\n他到底能不能付得起全款。
Lotsa folks talk a big talk. It’s been a while since we last had a chat, so maybe ya lost your touch.
现在有太多喜欢说大话的人了，\n而且这段时间他也没再联系我，\n我必须考虑这份工作还算不算数。
'Fraid not. I ain't honorable, but I do what I do, and I do a mighty fine job of it.
抱歉，不行，\n虽然我这个人没什么荣誉感，\n但这是我该做的事情，\n我自当以极高的质量完成它。
I got paid, I got Pokémon, and you know what that means.
就算他真的就此失踪，\n我也得到了定金和这些宝可梦，\n这笔买卖仍然不亏。
Oh, ya don’t have to tell me twice.
我觉得这点我们目的一致。
I figure lettin’ you have a crack at 'em gives you a neat little leg up in a way that’s still me doing my job, ya get it?
反正我也要找训练的对手，\n即能完成份内的工作，\n又能帮你出一口气，\n我完全没有拒绝的理由？
So, ya got time for a match?
所以，要来一场对战吗？
I know, I know, I do it every time, but I got debts to pay. We can chat afterwards, if that’s what you’re after.
毕竟我还有些债务要还，\n相比你应该没有这样的苦恼吧。\n有什么想闲聊的话题，\n那就等打完之后再说吧。
Whaddya say?
你觉得呢？
I ain’t goin’ nowhere. Drop by, yeah?
我暂时不会离开这里，\n所以，请便。
Well, let’s see what your brother’s got for ya.
好的，让我们一起看看，\n你哥哥想给你带来些什么。
Back for a li’l sneak peek? Ya damned rascal.
回来偷看一下？\n你真淘气。
Well, ya took care of that well enough, didn’t ya?
看吧，你这不是处理得很好吗？
Maybe Zain’s better than I am. He’s going through gyms, ain’t he?
当然也有可能赞恩比我更强，\n他不是也在挑战道馆吗？
I never did have the time for that.
我还从来没试过道馆挑战。
I was working for Chasm back when Yezera and I were fightin’. Then they set up the gyms.
以前频频跟叶泽拉对战的时候，\n我还在为裂隙队工作，\n道馆都是那之后才建起来的。
Yezera got through 'em like nothin’, but at that point… I wasn’t feelin’ it.
对她来说，应对这种挑战，\n都是小菜一碟，\n但我...那时候并没太在意这些。
Don’t feel like talkin’ about her too much, though. She’s got enough on her plate without me gossipin’.
算了，我不太想多谈论她，\n她身上的麻烦已经够多的了，\n不想再传闲话。
Didn’t I just say I wasn’t gonna gossip?
我说了，不想再传闲话。
But everybody knows it: she went missin’. Couldn’t handle the spotlight.
就像每个人都知道的，\n她因为无法承受被人注视的感觉，\n而选择突然消失。
Hell, could barely handle a conversation with most folks. Been like that since she was a tot.
如果周围人太多，\n她几乎无法进行正常交流，\n从还是个孩子时就这样了。
Ya better respect your elders, kid.
小家伙，学会尊重你的前辈。
I ain’t talked your ear off half as much as my grandpappy did.
我的唠叨程度比起我爷爷，\n连一半水准都没有。
Ya know you don’t hafta come find me, yeah? I didn’t hunt you down.
你根本不用来找我说什么，\n我也没有刻意跟着你。
What, of Yezera’s?
嗯？你是说叶泽拉的？
Best damn friend there ever was.
我们是最好的朋友，永远都是。
Sure, I was a bully back then, but ain’t nobody bullied her but me.
当然，我以前可能性子有些过激，\n但除了我，没有人欺负过她。
We fought like Zangoose and Seviper, ya know that?
我们就像猫鼬斩跟饭匙蛇那样\n总是莫名其妙扭打在一起，\n能理解我的意思？
But 'nuff said. I gotta get out of town.
不过话说回来，\n我得离开这座城市了。
Things are 'bout to get messy – I gotta feeling.
我有一种预感，\n事情即将变得混乱。
So if you end up in the thick of it, keep your guard up.
所以如果你也深陷其中，\n一定要保持警惕。
'Member: slow is smooth, smooth is fast. Make it out of that, then we’ll talk.
记住：慢即顺，顺即快，\n如果你能挺过去，\n我们还有机会再聊闲篇吧。
Catch ya at that <imp>volcano in Casaba</imp>, yeah? And take this. Better you than Zain.
在<imp>甜瓜火山</imp>见怎样？\n还有，拿上这个，\n你比赞恩更适合拥有它。
The shops on this side of town are quite quaint.
城市这一侧的店铺相当古朴。
Lot of odds and ends, stuff you won't find anywhere else!
有很多杂七杂八的\n在别处找不到的东西！

我可以试着说服你\n我在做正确的事情。
I could – I could tell you so many reasons and justifications and… it wouldn’t matter.
我可以...可以告诉你很多理由，\n用各种方法辩解，\n但这都没有用。
We’re going to fight anyways. I’m not going to go easy on you – I can’t afford to.
我们无论如何都要战斗，\n我不会手下留情…\n我承受不起。
So… try to make sure they don’t – keep your Pokémon safe. I don’t want to hurt them. I just need to buy a little time.
所以...请确保他们不会受伤...\n保护好你的宝可梦。\n我不想伤害它们，\n我只需要拖延一点时间。
I… I’m in far too deep at this point to back out.
我已经陷入泥潭了，\n没有抽身的可能。
Good. I don’t… I don’t want to hurt you, either.
好的，我也…\n不想伤害你。

我做不到...\n阿莱莎在你面前就像个普通士兵。
Well. I've gotten what I came for; slowed you down.
好了，我已经得到我想要的了，\n拖延了足够多的时间。
I'm… glad to be your rival. Thanks.
我…很高兴成为你的对手。\n谢谢。
I – uhf. I crippled one of their teams, but they got away. They’re good, dammit. And I’m out of practice.
我…呃...\n我打败了他们中的一个，\n但让他们逃走了。\n他们很强...该死！我也生疏了...
Here – I can heal your Pokémon. Mine are going to need a little care before I’m ready to move out. But you go on ahead. Here.
来，我可以治愈你的宝可梦。\n在出发之前，\n我的宝可梦需要休息一会儿，\n但你可以先上，这里。
You’ll use them better than I can.
你会比我用得更好。
Now go after them.

The door is tightly locked.
门被紧紧锁住了。
…Yezera, why would you – oh, \PN. Yeah, I can help heal your Pokémon.
…叶泽拉，你为什么要…\n哦，\PN。\n我可以帮助治愈你的宝可梦。
Now go deeper into the catacombs, one of them is still down there.

Desert with canals like circuit boards, or a mine where steel floor grows naturally.

My hands ain’t clean on that, either, and now someone’s trying to break out my old bruiser: Regidrago.
当然我也难辞其咎，\n现在有人试图解放那个老家伙：\n雷吉铎拉戈。
We don’t know who, and we don’t know why, but that thing was buried for a reason.
我们不知道他们是谁，\n也不知道为什么要这么做，\n但那个东西并不是\n无缘无故被封印的。
Because Yezera told us to, and because we – I’ll explain later. Time’s of the essence.
是叶泽拉让我们封印它们的，\n因为我们...\n我等会再解释，时间紧迫。
Yeah, and I’m sorry for not cluing you in earlier, but what’s done is done.
是的，很抱歉没有早点让你知道，\n但一切已经发生了。
We need to move, now, if we’re gonna catch whoever’s in there.

I can pull some strings, make sure you can catch up to your brother.
我可以帮你一些忙，\n让你能够更快地追上你的兄弟。
And if you don’t help, maybe the opposite. So quit whinging and help.

Follow me. If there’s a fight, you take point and I’ll flank. I’m good, but I’m not that good.
跟着我，\n我实力很强...但强得有限。\n如果有战斗，你走在前面，\n我会从侧面进攻。
They’re in the catacombs.
他们在地下墓穴里。
The door Regidrago’s locked behind should be impenetrable, but… let’s go check it out.

Red lines of graffiti criss-cross the word "magma". The word "lava" is written beneath.

Big ol' conspiracy, huh? Been lied to? Yeah, well, comes with the territory. Better get suited to it.
发现那个大阴谋了？\n感觉自己被骗了？\n嗯，这是常有的事，\n最好习惯一下。
'Course. We’re confidants, Yezera and I. Nearly decked her when she told me, too.
的确，我和叶泽拉是密友，\n她告诉我打算做的一切时，\n我差点没忍住揍她一顿。
But she always was the smarter one 'tween us. Who the hell am I to second-guess her?
但她一直是我们俩中更聪明的那个，\n我有什么资格去怀疑她呢？
Maybe I am, maybe I ain't. Don't matter much, do it? You plannin' on arresting me? Hah.
或许吧，谁知道呢，那不重要，\n还是说，你打算逮捕我？哈。
Looking right as rain, ain'tcha? Heard from a fortune teller that you’ve got a steel core to you.
这样就对了，\n我听说你有一颗钢铁般的内心。
Maybe she was right. Might be able to use that.
我想她说的没错，\n这正是你所拥有的品质。
Hah! Don’t kid me, babyface.
哈！别逗我了，小家伙。
But, uh, you ain't exactly the kid that strutted into Novo, cocky as all get-out.
不过，你已经不是之前那个，\n在望新镇自以为是的小孩了。
Still cocky. Got some ice to you, too, though.
虽然还是有些自以为是，\n起码比之前冷静很多。
Wasn’t plannin’ on inviting you out here to chat, though.
不过我不是邀请你\n来这种地方聊天的。
Goes like this: Yezera’s about to do somethin’ real stupid.
你应该也知道一些：\n叶泽拉要做一些不折不扣的傻事。
I ain’t bright enough to know if her plan’s worth it or not. Figure that’ll be settled with a duel – ain’t no other way for the likes of us.
我不够聪明，\n分不清她的计划是否值得，\n我想这将通过决斗来解决\n - 对于我们这样的人来说，\n没有其他的办法，不是吗？
And she’ll be facin’ one of us, so why don’t we get some training done?
她总要面对我们当中的一人，\n那不如趁此机会训练训练吧。
Don’tcha burn yourself out now. Push yourself too hard and ya might just snap.
不要让自己过度劳累，\n过度劳累会让你走向崩溃。
Oh, I oughta let you know: used to be I did bounty hunting for Chasm. I ain't about to play fair or clean.
现在我也应该说明白一些了：\n我曾经为裂隙队做过黑手套，\n所以我不会遵守所谓的“公平”。
I only play for keeps.
我只为胜利而战。
Ya ready?
准备好了吗？
Eh.
嗯。
I’ve fought better in my time, ain’t no question 'bout it.
看来我的水平还是有所下降，\n毕竟已经不再刀口舔血好多年了。
Still, ya beat me. Hope ya learned something.
既然你能打败我，\n我希望你也能从中学到些什么。
Kid, answer me somethin’. How do ya feel about Yezera?
小家伙，回答我一个问题，\n你是怎么看待叶泽拉的？
Ain’t much of an answer. I like her too, mind you; maybe a li'l too much.
这答案有点模糊了吧？\n不过我也喜欢她...\n或许喜欢得还有点太多了。
Figures. She ain’t easy to love sometimes, y’know? Goes double for when she’s up to somethin’ like this.
很正常，毕竟大家跟她之间\n总有不能相互理解的地方，\n尤其她现在还在做这些事。
Well, how 'bout that. You can tell I like ya, 'cause I ain’t even gonna hurt you for sayin’ that.
哼哼，看来你能看得出，\n我对你感觉也挺不错的，\n不会因为这句话而物理上揍你一顿。
'Cause she betrayed you? Or 'cause she’s obnoxious?
因为她背叛了你？\n还是单纯讨厌她的个性？
Or, heh, 'cause she keeps givin’ you a run for your money?
又或者她一直让你很头疼？
Don’t really matter what you say. If wishes were Rhyhorn, yeah?
不管怎么说都无所谓了，\n毕竟嘴是会骗人的。
We’ll see which side of the line ya fall on when it comes down to it.
等到真正需要选择的时候，\n我们就能看出你站在哪一边了。

I've lived a life of luxury, in no small part due to my lucrative career as a Trainer.
我年轻时作为一名训练家，\n赚了不少钱，\n所以能过上富足奢华的生活。

马凯亚的宝可梦联盟\n聚集了很多阴谋论者。
The region doesn't have a traditional Elite Four, and Gym Leaders here aren't exactly career Trainers either.

Some especially harsh critics have claimed that the whole thing is simply a front for a rebranding of Team Chasm.

Makya is at a critical point in its history.
马凯亚正处于历史的关键节点。
Either we become a fully fledged region, or we get relegated as merely secondary.

Cool. If you don’t mind, I’m gonna add a little bit of chaos into the mix: you’ll lose your cool before I do.
很好，如果你不介意，\n我想稍微混入一点混乱元素：\n你会在我之前躁动起来。
Yeah, sure thing. I’m more of an artist than a fighter, but I hear I’m not half bad.
没问题。\n比起战士我更倾向于艺术家的身份，\n但我的战斗水平也不差。

Now that you've beat all of Scilla's students, she's probably going to make us do extra training.

Hello, \PN.
你好，\PN。
I’m sorry. I’ve invited you here under false pretenses.
很抱歉，\n我用一个假借口把你骗来这边了。
In my research I noted you and a certain individual meeting several times.
在研究过程中，\n我注意到了一个\n跟你有过几次交集的人。
I would later discover her to be the former Champion, Yezera.
后来才发现她是前冠军叶泽拉。
I have reason to believe she is behind the emergence of the avatars.
我有充足的理由相信\n她就是化身出现的幕后黑手。
I understand you may be unwilling to part with any information you have concerning this. I suggest a duel.
我知道你可能不愿意透露太多，\n那我们不妨靠决斗来决定吧！
The loser will tell the victor the whole truth.
输家要向胜者透露全部真相。
Good.
很好。
That may be so. Dedicated trainers seem to have some kind of honor to their matches, though.
或许吧，但对训练家来说，\n这样的比试也有关荣誉感不是吗？
I would like to ensure you are telling me everything. It seems as if a loss may compel you to reveal what you would otherwise hide.
我想确保能得知我想要的一切，\n如果你输了，\n我可能会问一些更深入的问题。
Those are my conditions. I will fight you before I have anything more to do with you.
这只是我的条件，\n在我们相互坦白前的战斗。
If you would like to leave, you may.
如果你实在不愿意，\n我也没有什么办法。
Yes. What honor compels you trainers is beyond me.
的确，我很难以自己的思维，\n理解你们训练家的荣誉感。
I plan to uphold my end of the deal, though. I believe your bizarre code of conduct will force you to, as well.
我会遵守我们的协议，\n我同时相信你们奇怪的行为准则\n也会迫使你这样做。
Now, if you would like time to prepare, or simply to escape, do so now.
所以，无论你需要时间准备，\n还是就此逃跑，趁现在吧。
If not, then we shall duel.
如果不需要，那就开始吧。
Go. I’ll wait.
好吧，我会在这里等你。
I understand you are the current Champion. I am more skilled than you may expect, though.
我知道你是现任冠军，\n不过，我比你想象中更强。
You returned. Are you ready?
你回来了，准备好了？
Yes, well, I suppose I expected this. The odds of beating a Champion were low.
是啊，我早就想到了，\n想打败冠军没那么容易。
I did the best I could, and now I will tell you the whole truth. Maybe your response will tell me what I want to know.
我已经尽力了，愿赌服输，\n现在我会告诉你全部真相，\n也许你的回应也能告诉我\n我想知道的答案。
I have discovered the locations of at least four of the five Regi tombs.
我已经找到四个巨人墓穴的位置了。
I am also aware of Yezera’s abduction of the Regis, and that some part of her plan has caused the avatars. My final finding is that... none of it matters.
我也知道叶泽拉带走了它们，\n她的计划导致了化身的出现，\n但我的最终发现是...\n这一切都没有意义。
Not for my purposes.
对于我的目的来说没有意义。
Makya is a large, vibrant ecosystem. The pressures which generate a new regional form are more complicated than one can simply infer.
马凯亚拥有一个庞大\n且充满活力的生态系统，\n这里新的地区形态的出现，\n比人们的想象和推断更复杂。
In my pride, I thought an outsider’s perspective could unravel this mystery.
或许是因为我的自负，\n以为以一个局外人的视角，\n能解开这里的谜团。
The Regis, the avatars, the regional forms – all connected, of course, but not cleanly. The world is not a clean place.
巨人、化身、地区形态...\n我相信它们之间都有所联系，\n但这种联系又并不直观，\n显然这个世界并没有那么干净。
I am glad you agree. If you had a simple solution I had missed, I would be rather embarrassed.
我很高兴你能认可，\n如果我忽略了什么明显的点...\n光是想想就觉得尴尬。
Even a negative result is worth determining for certain. I don’t have answers. I do have experience, and data.
即便是不好的结果，\n也值得大家去研究、确定，\n我虽然没能得到答案，\n但积累了足够的经验和数据。
Yes. I plan to prove my abilities in more realistic ways than solving an entire region’s mysteries.
没错，所以我计划，\n用比起解决地区的谜题，\n更为现实的方法证明自己的能力。
I don’t. I’ve determined my problem. Now I’m fixing it.
我并不会自责，\n现在已经确定了摆在面前的问题，\n只要一点点解决它就好了。
But I am also not finished, as I have only told you half the truth.
但即便如此我也没有完成目标...\n我现在也只说了一半真相而已。
My challenge and this location were for a higher purpose.
我做这一切有着更高的目的。
I noted Makya’s vast diversity of species and set my sights on a particular trio. Prior to this moment, they have only been found in an extremely specific locale.
为了更加了解马凯亚的物种多样性，\n我把目光投向了它们三个...\n这三种之前只在一个\n特定地区出现过的宝可梦。
But, drawn by the sound of brutal conflict, in a place such as this...
可它们又为什么被这样一个 充满残酷冲突的地方吸引来呢？
Pulp and Fantasy
芳草与奇幻
Conflict against a hero such as you, in a location similar to their home such as this, draws them out.
在这样一个类似它们家园的地方，\n与你这样的英雄的一场对战，\n正好能把它们吸引出来。
I have been untrue, however. I have fought you before. I was masked.
而且，我...还隐瞒了一件事，\n之前我...就和你战斗过...\n我戴着面具的时候。
I have determined I have made a mistake there, too. Primordial truth would elude us even if the world is reverted. There is no point.
但我已经认识到自己的错误了，\n就算世界恢复原初状态，\n真理也会离我们而去，毫无意义。
The world is complicated, and always has been. My inability to solve such a relatively-trivial mystery suggests my plan was foolish.
世界一直都是如此的复杂...\n我无法解决这样的谜团，\n也就此证明了我的愚蠢。
Please excuse my repeated deceptions. I did, in fact, determine quite a bit of this on my own.
请原谅我一而再的隐瞒，\n实际上...至少今天，\n我已经把该说的都告诉你了。
The nature of the regional forms is still a pursuit of mine. I plan to continue it, so Yezera must be stopped.
我会继续研究地区形态的问题，\n这是我一直在做的课题，\n所以，请一定阻止叶泽拉。
If you wish, I would suggest you take these birds of the battlefield with you. I planned to use them against you. Now I suggest the reverse.
如果你愿意，\n我建议你带上它们一起，\n可笑我曾经还打算用它们对付你，\n但现在，完全反过来了。
I will leave you to your preparations. I have many years of study left in Makya, and plan to not waste them.
等你准备好之后，\n就来收下它们吧，\n我还会在这里学习研究几年。
I rest easy knowing you will not let my efforts be in vain. Goodbye, \PN.
将一切交给你我很放心，\n我知道你不会让我的努力白费，\n再见，\PN。
There they are. Bringers of carnage.
它们就在这儿，\n带来屠杀的使者。
Only a battle against a Champion in an environ similar to their home might draw them out, if they lurked here at all.
只有在类似它们家园的环境中，\n与冠军级别的英雄战斗，\n才可能将潜伏在附近的它们引出来。
I have confirmed my hypothesis, and can rest easy.
当然这只是个假设，\n现在假设已被验证，\n我也可以放心了。
If you wish to catch them, or merely fight them, you may do so. I will leave you to your amusements.
无论你想抓住它们\n还是仅仅与它们战斗，\n那就是你自己的选择了。
Goodbye, \PN. Thank you. I have many more years of study left in Makya, thanks to you.
再见，\PN。\n谢谢你，多亏了你，\n我在马凯亚的研究得以继续下去。
Fine.
好吧
I'd tell you anyways.
本就没打算隐瞒
No.
我拒绝
Seems unenforceable.
这办不到
Give me a minute.
给我一分钟
I'm ready now.
准备好了
That's true.
确实
So it was pointless?
所以就没意义？
Pride is right.
自信很正常
Don't beat yourself up.

离开这里...\n哦！你...\n你是在这里找东西？
Come back and, uh, I’ll still be... around.

I took some classes in the gym here.
我在这个道馆里补过几节课。
I was a bit scared cause I heard how tough Samorn is.
一开始我有些胆战心惊的，\n大家都知道赛蒙有多强。
She's the strongest gym leader in the whole region!
她是这个地区最强的道馆馆主！
But she's really nice. I had a great time.
但她平日很是和善，\n悬着的心终于放下了。
Oh! I knew I’d find you here, my hero.
我就知道会在这里遇到你，\n我的英雄。
You’re looking particularly ravishing today.
你今天看起来真迷人。
Your gaze is like a summer night... getting me all hot under the collar.
你的目光就像夏夜一样...\n让我感到又闷又热。
Excuse my directness. I’m getting carried away. Hello, \PN.
抱歉，请原谅我的直白，\n我有点失控了...\n咳...你好，\PN。
Strange days. Strange days indeed! There’s an excitement in the air.
今天是个奇怪的日子！\n我能闻到空气中的兴奋感。
Oh, don’t flatter me. It’ll go straight to my head.
哦，别太夸我，我会骄傲的。
Aww, have I upset you? Please, I don’t mean a word of it, if that’s what you want to hear.
啊，我让你感到难受了吗？\n那抱歉，刚才的话都当是谎话吧。
...It’s been a long day. I get... flustered after days like these. Sorry.
...今天是漫长的一天，\n像这样的日子让我有点慌乱。
A certain trainer you may know grabbed me by the collar. Then she told me in detail what she’d do to me if I ever laid my hands on Yezera.
或许你也认识某个训练家，\n她会抓住我的衣领警告我，\n如果我敢碰叶泽拉就怎样怎样的。
Now, as much as I might like to do exactly that... I haven’t. And won’t. She’s unattainable.
尽管我很想这样做…\n但我并没有出手，也不会出手，\n她是可望而不可及的。
Sorry, sorry. Let me explain myself. As much as I can.
抱歉，抱歉，\n让我来尽可能地解释一下。
Oh, for sure! She’s so appealing because of her reclusiveness. Oh, to rehabilitate her with endless kindness.
没错，当然是这样！\n尤其是最后的选择，真吸引人，\n用无尽的善意让她慢慢恢复。
Who isn’t? So tremulous, so frail, yet so powerful. Don’t you want to hug her back to health?
谁不是呢？\n如此娇羞脆弱，却又如此强大...\n你不想拥抱她，让她恢复健康吗？
Oh, now, yes, of course. Don’t be jealous. You’ve got all her verve and aren’t as... high-maintenance.
诶呀，不要嫉妒嘛、\n你拥有着她所有的活力，\n而且...没那么难相处。
You see, I used to be obsessed with her. It’s why I’m here.
所以，这就是我曾经迷恋她，\n但现在出现在这里的原因。
I could be the one to track her down, lure her out like a timid beast. I just wanted to take care of her.
我只是想照顾她，\n也愿意成为那个追踪她，\n像一只胆怯的野兽一样\n引诱她出来的人。
And she was beautiful, of course. I’m not so high-minded as to discount her graceful splendor as part of my reasoning.
当然，她也很美，\n我也不会高估自己的能力，\n不会将她优美的风度\n排除在我的行动之外。
But then I arrived here... and I found you. My attention was caught immediately.
但是当我来到这里…发现了你，\n我的注意力立刻被吸引了。
I’m so sorry. I just can’t really contain my feelings any longer. I like you. A lot. And I’d like you to be mine.
我很抱歉，\n但我无法再控制我的感情了，\n我喜欢你，非常喜欢，\n我想让你成为我的。
Shh. It’s OK. You’re confused and surprised and scared, but that’s alright.
你是觉得困惑、惊讶还是害怕？\n嘘...没事的，没关系的。
What’s life without a little fear? Adds a little color to proceedings, doesn’t it?
没有一点恐惧的人生算什么？\n它为生活增添了一点色彩，\n不是吗？
But I assure you my intentions are pure and loving.
我可以向你保证，\n我的意图是纯洁和充满爱意的。
Don’t turn me away so easily, \PN. I know I’m a lot.
不要这么轻易地拒绝我，\n\PN，我知道我...
I come on strong. Well, the incandescence inside my heart leaches out through my body.
表现得过于强势了，\n将我心中的光辉透露出了太多。
I want you, and I want to be yours. I can’t hide it.
我想要你，我想成为你的人，\n我无法隐藏这份愿望。
Oh, love, how I’ve longed to hear you say it.
我多么渴望听到你这么说，\n这或许就是爱吧。
You’re beautiful when you smile, you know that? More gorgeous than an open sky. Deific in your grace.
你微笑时很美，你知道吗？\n比开阔的天空更美丽，\n你的优雅神圣不可侵犯。
But I don’t want you to rush into this. Take your time. We can move slowly.
但我不希望你过于匆忙，\n慢慢来，我们可以慢慢前进。
\PN, I don’t want to be your friend. I don’t know that I even want to be your lover.
\PN，我不想成为你的朋友，\n我不确定我是否想成为你的情人。
I want to be with you. I want you to be mine, forever. I want you to be my crescent moon to illuminate my starless skies.
我想和你在一起，\n我希望你永远属于我，\n我希望你能成为我的明月，\n照亮我这片没有星星的天空。
Here. Take this as a token of my boundless love.
拿着这个，\n作为我无尽爱意的象征。
To show you I’m honest, and that I only want the best for you. This is the true color of my love for you.
为了向你表明我忠诚的心，\n以及我对你的予取予求。\n这就是我对你的爱的颜色。
Let this gift saturate your soul. Let it dye you with my affections. Let it be the start of our eternal romance.
让这份礼物浸润你的灵魂，\n让它染上我对你的感情，\n让它成为我们永恒浪漫的开始。
You’re amazing. Everything I saw in Yezera, in the avatars, even in the myths and legends, are all in you. You’re radiant. I want to bask in that radiance.
你太棒了，我在叶泽拉、\n化身、甚至神话传说中看到的一切，\n都在你身上浮现，如此光辉璀璨，\n让我忍不住想沐浴在其中。
Think about it.
好好感受吧。
I’d love you more than anyone else ever could. Go and take care of your material affairs. Your badges and your tournament – all those trivial things.
我会比任何人都更爱你，\n去处理你那些世俗的事务吧，\n把徽章、比赛什么的都弄好。
And then find me. Somewhere... romantic.
然后来找我，\n在某个…浪漫的地方。
The top of a snowy mountain, overlooking the entire world. Beautiful. Stern and rugged and powerful. With an ancient soul.

You'd think that Samorn, the gym leader down there, would have issues getting around in her wheelchair.
你觉得赛蒙，\n也就是下面那个道馆的馆主，\n坐着轮椅会不会行动不便？
Especially in difficult terrain like this.
尤其是在需要爬坡下坡的地形。
At first I thought she'd use her dragons to help her down, but apparently that's too awkward.
起初我以为她会用自己的\n龙属性宝可梦来帮她，\n但那也显得太笨了。
Instead she just has her Runerigus do the heavy lifting. It isn't part of her team, so it gets to relax at home the rest of the day, too.
其实她一直用\n一只迭失板来做各种重活，\n而这只宝可梦并不在\n她的常规出战列表里。
Hello. My Druddigon and I handle trips down to Samorn's gym.

You're here too early.
但你来的太早了。
Samorn only takes the strongest of challengers, and you aren't strong enough yet.
赛蒙只接待最强大的挑战者，\n显然你还不够格。
Go get all of the other badges first. Then you might be strong enough.
先把其他徽章都拿到手，\n然后才有这个资格。

Don't even think about challenging the Dreadnaught until you've aquired every other Makyan badge.
在获得马凯亚其他徽章前，\n就不要妄图挑战这里了。
Oh, hello. I see you have some climbing gear.
嘿，你好，\n我看到你有一些攀岩设备。
I suppose that means you could go down to the gym on your own power.
也就是说你可以自行前往道馆了。
I wouldn't recommend it. You still have a lot of growth to do.
但我不建议你现在挑战，\n你还有很多其他事可以做。
Yes! You are the proper level of strength to challenge the Dreadnaught.
哈哈，你的实力已经足够了。
I'm sure she will be pleased to battle you.
我相信她会很高兴与你交手的。
You've bested the Dreadnaught! Well fought.
你打败了无畏的赛蒙，很好！

I'm eager to try out this Arcanine, so hit me up post- haste!
我很想试试风速狗的实力，\n所以尽快来找我吧！
We could add to the history of this place by engaging in a struggle of training supremacy. You inclined?
我们要进行一场训练至上的对战吗？\n为这里的历史添上浓墨重彩的一比！
Understood.
明白了。
I'll be here until you wish to battle.
你准备好了再来找我吧。
When I win, I'm gonna shout something very quotable.
如果我赢了，\n我一定得喊几句名言警句。
Rock doggy.... no....
诶呀啊啊...不...
Heh, now I know how the grunts felt when Yezera whipped their butts.
呵呵，现在我好像明白\n叶泽拉在面对那些士兵时的感受了。
Leave me to the task of reviving my battlers.
让我先复活我的战士吧。
Vanya breathes out heavily.
凡雅重重地出了口气。
So, this is it. The very last badge. After this comes the championship, you know.
就是它了，最后一枚徽章，\n之后就是竞技大会了。
Even more than usual, I can't afford to mess this one up.
比起往常，这次更不能出错。
Thank you for your help. Now it's just up to me to do what I've trained to do.
感谢你一直以来的帮助，\n现在轮到我去挑战了。

馆主：赛蒙
History and motion.

Hey, kiddo. Knew you’d show up sooner or later. You took to training like a Wooper to water, didn’t you?
呵，小鬼，我就知道你会来，\n你应该跟乌波一样适应环境了对吧？
Had to work myself to the bone to get here before you and, guess what? Gym leader’s out again.
为了在你之前赶到这里，\n我不得不拼命往这边赶，\n你猜怎么着？馆主又不在。
You waiting for me to throw a Poké Ball at you?
你在等我往你身上扔球吗？
I’m not gonna. Not about to bruise my team just before challenging the gym.
我才不会做这种蠢事，\n在挑战道馆之前，\n我可不想降低队伍的战斗力。
Yes, \PN. I snuck down here and put a sign on the door saying it’s closed after beating the gym, just to trick you.
你猜对了，\PN，\n我悄悄溜到这里，\n在道馆门上放了个关门的牌子，\n就是为了骗你。
It’s a flawless plan, really.
这真是个蠢到掉渣的计划。
Not if you schedule in advance.
除非你提前预约。
Or that’s what I’d like to say – professionalism isn’t in this region’s blood.
或者我这么说吧...\n这个地区的人都不怎么敬业。
Don’t even get me STARTED on that man in the bayou. Insufferable.
总之，别再谈这个地区的讨厌鬼了。
In any case, Samorn’s out.
现在的情况就是赛蒙不在。
Sign on the door says she’s dealing with some ruckus over at the dig site. You coming?
门上的牌子说\n她正在处理挖掘现场的骚乱，\n你要一起去看看？
That’s what I thought. Let’s go.
这就是我希望的答案，走吧。
Oh, you want to be contrary, do you? Fine. Stay here and wait.
哦，你不想去是吗？\n好吧，那你就留在这等着吧。
The dig site. West of town.
挖掘现场就在这里西边。
I swear, sometimes you’re more thick-skulled than a Rampardos. Let’s go perform some heroics, shall we?
虽说有时候你比战槌龙还拗，\n但去做些英勇的事也没什么不好的，\n对吧？
The railway here used to be pretty nice, but it got destroyed when that girl took Team Chasm down.
以前这里的铁路相当漂亮，\n但从那个女孩击败了裂隙队后，\n它就被摧毁了。
No one's ever really gotten to repairing the whole thing, too much hassle for too little gain.
然后就没人愿意修复它了，\n因为太麻烦，收益又小。
Most of the dirt and heavy equipment are already where they need to be.
明明大部分的泥土\n和重型设备已经准备好了。
Closed while Samorn participates in the Makya Championship Tournament.
马凯亚竞技大会期间闭馆。
Hey, trying to get Samorn's badge as well? I've tried, but I've had no luck so far.
你也想获得赛蒙的徽章？\n我之前试过，但一直没成功。
I was prepped for countering a Sandstorm strategy, based on the legends I heard.
我明明已经根据收集到的情报，\n做好了应对沙暴队的准备。
But she apparently hasn't used that strategy in forever, despite how well suited to it some of her Pokemon are.
但是她还有其他的战斗策略，\n即便她的宝可梦很适合沙暴天气。
Maybe it's a "hiding your true power level" thing? I just don't get it...
或许这也是一种\n“隐藏真实实力”的方法？
You got the 8th badge? Damn, that means I gotta get myself one.
你得到了第八个徽章了？\n看来我也得找时间去拿一个了。
I want to at least make it to the Championship this year.
今年起码去竞技大会露个脸。
Um, hi?
呃...你好？
You're acting different.
你咋了？
Same to you.
我觉得你也是
You're a creep.
你好奇怪...
Wait, what?
你在说什么？
Good for her.
她很棒
You're into Yezera?
你喜欢叶泽拉？
Eyes only for me?
跟我有关系？
Um.
......
Hell no.
不可能
I feel the same way.
我觉得可以
Can we be friends?
成为朋友？
Maybe later.
等会儿
Sure, let's go.
来吧
You kidding me?
你在开玩笑？
Happens a lot.
这种事经常发生
Of course.
当然
Nah.
不要
Where?
在哪里？

[Map216]
Phione! \PN! What just happened here?
霏欧纳！\PN！\n这是怎么回事？
What? They can do that? Like, Phione BECAME an avatar? That’s insane!
什么...他们竟然能...\n把霏欧纳变成一个化身？
I’ve been trying to find Phione for hours now!
我和它几小时前...分开了，\n我一直在找它！
And then when I finally do it’s you fighting it as a fricking avatar?
但是...终于找到的时候，\n你正在跟变成化身的它战斗？
Yeah! What’d you do? I mean – I’m not blaming you, but what happened here?
这...为什么？\n我...我不是怪你，但是...\n这到底都发生了什么？
OK, sorry, I get it. You’re confused too.
抱歉...我知道你也很困惑...
Phione was acting strange – standoffish, kinda hostile.
前不久，霏欧纳突然变得好奇怪...\n它冷漠，还带着浓浓的敌意。
Then it lashed out at me and bolted. I’ve been hunting it since then.
然后它对我发动了攻击，\n然后就逃走了，\n我从那时起就一直在找它。
It looks OK now… you couldn’t’ve KO’d it any gentler?
现在...应该没事吧...\n你不能...轻轻地...打倒它吗？
Ah, it’s alright. No major scrapes or bruises – it’ll be fine. Just need to do some first aid…
啊，没事的...\n没有很严重的伤势...\n它会没事的，只需要治疗一下...
I get that, but c’mon.
我知道，但是...
It’s obviously – I don’t know, possessed or something. Messed up in the head.
我..我不知道..\n它应该是被什么占据了...\n导致...头脑混乱什么的。
It’s not too bruised. Just need to do some first aid…
没有很严重的伤势...\n它会没事的，只需要治疗一下...
Well… yeah. Sure. It’s an avatar.
啊...也对，毕竟...\n现在它是一个化身。
Don’t pull your punches. Well, no harm no foul. Just need to do some first aid…
你没有理由手下留情...\n还好，没有很严重的伤势...\n它会没事的，只需要治疗一下...
Insane. Complete insanity. It attacked me, turned into an avatar, attacked you…
这到底是怎么了？\n为什么，它会攻击我？\n然后还变成化身，攻击你...
What would’ve happened if you hadn’t beaten it?
如果你没有打败它又会发生什么...
Ah, no use thinking about it. I just… I feel terrible. I feel just awful, because honestly I’m relieved.
啊...想那些也没用...\n我只是...一时...\n我感到很糟糕，但这样也好。
Because if it wasn’t an avatar, then it just left. It just left me. It hated me.
如果它没有变成化身，\n就选择攻击我，离开我...
Yeah. Because at least it didn’t really hate me. It didn’t leave me.
也就是说，它并没有恨我，\n并没有因为讨厌我才离开。
It’s hard. I was so afraid that it’d just left me that anything else is, like, a breath of fresh air.
我好怕它会离开我...
Well… we’ll see. Hopefully it’ll wake up and this’ll all be a distant memory.
还好...它会醒来的，\n这一切都会过去的。
Something we can laugh about, yeah?
将来或许还会成为笑谈，对吧？
And… damn, I keep bringing you into this?
而且...我总是把你牵扯进来...
You gotta bail me outta everything. Well, thanks.
谢谢你做的一切，谢谢。
Here. I’ve had these for a while, but I don’t really need them now. For one reason or another.
这个给你了，出于某种原因...\n我已经不再需要它们了。
Doesn’t really make us even, but thanks.
当然这不足以报答你的恩情，\n权当我微不足道的谢意吧。
I need to get Phione somewhere safer, but I’ll see you. Thanks for everything.
现在我得带着霏欧纳去安全的地方了，\n我们还会再见的。
North: Cave of Hatching
北：启明之窟
East: Frostflow Farms
东：风霜农场
Have you seen my new avatar defense technique? Pokésand, go!
要见识一下我抵御化身的新招数吗？\n宝可沙，出击！
Hmm, back to the drawing board on this one.
嗯，看来还需要重新设计。
The technique is for avatars, not Trainers. I can't expect it to work perfectly here.
这个技巧是针对化身的，\n不是针对训练家的。\n我不指望它在对战中也能完美发挥。
Huh? Weather wars? What's that?
啥？天气战争？\n那是什么？
Hey! It's uh... the guy you saw near the Regice Chamber.
哦，你是...\n我在雷吉秘室看到的那个人。
I think I got a decent understanding of what's happened to me.
我或许多多少少\n对自己身上发生的事情有些了解。
Whatever I was, it kept me separated from the world for a while. A lot has changed.
无论我到底是谁，\n它都让我暂时与世界隔绝了，\n这让很多事情都发生了变化。
Team Chasm is done. People have moved on, though not totally.
裂隙队已经走到了终点，\n人们应当向前看了，\n尽管很多人不这么想。
Rangers got me set up good. I have a lot of old friends that thought I was dead. They were more than happy to help me when I showed up.
义军们把我安置得很好，\n很多老朋友都以为我死了，\n但我出现时，大家都愿意帮助我。
In a way, Hoopa really did help me. Got to skip out on some of the rough parts of Team Chasm breaking up, and I'm taken care of.
不得不说，胡帕在某些方面帮了我，\n我躲过了裂隙队解散时的一些麻烦，\n还得到了不错的照顾。
I'm... ok. In a weird way. But that's life for ya, huh? It's all weird, and then it isn't. And you're ok.
我的生活方式很奇怪？\n但这就是生活，\n尽管奇怪，只要过得好就可以了。
That's life. Weird, but you're ok.
这就是生活，奇怪，但又合适。
That's a nice feeling, you know?
你不觉得这种感觉很好吗？
Sheeeeeeesh, let's get a looksie at this this little Trainer now!
哦哦哦，快看这个小训练家！
Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit, this here Trainer's got us slapped silly!
好吧，你可以随便给我取外号，\n竟然被这样打败了！
What a howdown from our Trainer friend here. Bet they got one o' those fancy candy thingamajigs.
我们的训练家朋友真会说话，\n想必一定吃了不少糖吧。
A Pokemon world, and within every battle, a world of struggle.
奋斗与竞争，\n在宝可梦的一生，\n多少败与成。
How much can I fit, into a haiku format? I'm running out of...
俳句的格式的确很严格，\n能塞的东西有限...
A loud crashing lake, Chatot chirp in the distance, they sing united.
湖畔水声漾，\n与聒噪鸟的清嗓，\n一曲共颂唱。
I write, erase, rewrite. Erase again, and then, my Ditto changes.
一字一音替，\n不知不觉日偏西，\n百变怪作笔。
You can barely make out the outline of a cave entrance behind the waterfall.
勉强可以透过瀑布，\n看到后面洞口的轮廓。
Well golly me we got a cheater! Looks like they did a little bit of hackerooni.
我们遇到作弊高手了！\n他绝对用了什么黑客技术。
Well I ain't never seen a scrap like that since before my pa started herding Tauros with his bare hands.
除了我那个\n徒手跟肯泰罗较劲的老爸，\n我已经很久没见过这种废物了。
Real shame what happened to his favorite knee.
真是耻辱啊！
Heya, Trainer!
嗨，训练家
I heard that a Champion was going to be here, but I coulnd't find them.
我听说有个冠军要来这里，\n但我找不到人。
I even brought a Krabby to throw at them and everything! I stole it from a Ranger when he wasn't looking.
我甚至还趁义军不注意，\n偷了只大钳蟹想扔向他！
If I can't throw it at someone important, I'll sell it to get some ice cream!
如果见不到冠军的话，\n那就把它卖了去买冰淇淋吧！
$5000! That'll get me ice cream for a week!
$5000！\n我就可以连续吃一周冰淇淋了！
You're lucky you're a nobody, otherwise I'd throw it at you.
你应该庆幸自己没什么名气，\n不然我就要用大钳蟹扔你了。
Done deal Trainer!
交易完成，训练家
\PN hands over $5000 in exchange.
\PN将$5000交给对方。
Maybe I'll get chocolate today...
要不还是去买巧克力吧…
Haha, you're poor! That's really funny!
哈哈，穷鬼，嘿嘿！
My Pokemon love the trees and grass. They also love battling!
我的宝可梦们喜欢树木和草丛，\n也很喜欢战斗！
What's that, my Pokemon? You want to go to the pub?
我的宝可梦这是...\n想去酒吧？
I have no choice, I must listen to them. Bye bye!
我只能听它们的了，再见！
Good battling! You should fight my brother, too. He's all the way at the end of the river.
打得不错，\n或许你有兴趣跟我哥也来一场，\n他就在这条河的尽头。
...
...
You're cheating, right?
你在作弊！
I'm just here to play my guitar. No idea who the other guy is...
我只是来弹吉他的，\n根本不认识那个人...
Welp, I'll have to abandon my Cave of Hatching visit...
看来我不得不放弃\n前往启明之窟的旅程了...
The entrance is blocked, and I stupidly didn't bring any climbing gear.
入口被堵住了，\n我也没带什么登山装备。
If I did, I could have climbed around, but alas.
不然我就能直接爬过去了。
All I wanted was to experience the legend...
我只是想去体验下传说中的...
Take this item, I'm clearly not worthy of it...
把这个拿走吧，我不配...
It was an avatar.
这是个化身
You're here?
你也在啊
You're asking me?
你问我我问谁
Sorry.
抱歉
It was attacking me.
它也会攻击我
Could've. Didn't.
可以但我不这么打算
Why?
为什么？
That it was possessed?
你觉得它被附身了
Don't beat yourself up.
不要自责
No thanks.
不用了，谢谢。
I'll take it.
我会收下它。
[Map217]
It's the bottom of a conveyor belt. It'd be impossible to climb up.
这里是传送带的底部，爬不上去的。
For most of Sweetrock's history, we've relied on Clefable teleportation to get cargo from the factory to the docks.
多年以前的蜜岩港，\n都是靠皮皮的传送能力，\n把货物运到码头的。
We got these conveyor belts installed a few years back, so the cliffside isn't an issue anymore.
最近几年我们安装了传送带，\n为货物的运输工作提供便利。
We still have to rely on teleportation to get in and out of the harbor, though.
当然，皮皮们并没有因此失业，\n现在依然需要它们的传送能力。
Looks like the Trainer ahead is moving to block you from going any further.
前方的训练家\n显然不会允许你通过。
Do you want to approach them? It looks like a tough fight.
要贸然靠近他们吗？\n这将是一场恶战。
I knew you would arrive, should I only wait.
我就知道你会来这里。
Excuse the charade – I would prefer my identity remain enshrouded in mystery for now.
至于这份伪装，请别在意，\n目前我们还得隐藏身份。
All that you are required to understand is who I serve – Yezera. Under her profound guidance, we have achieved our goals.
你只需要知道我们为叶泽拉工作，\n并在她的指导下，\n一步步完成我们的目标。
The titans have served their purpose. I come then with a simple inquiry: will you not listen to my reasoning?
这次行动已经结束了，\n而我等在这里只是为了问一句，\n你愿不愿意听一下我们的理由。
Thank you. Our goal is naught less than a complete reordering of the world.
谢谢，我们的目标，\n不仅仅是为了重构这个世界。
My comrades have their own motives, but mine is simple.
每个人都有自己的动机，\n而我的愿望很简单。
The world at present is mercurial and deceptive. Human culture and technology serves as naught but a veil disguising ultimate truth.
目前的世界充满了欺骗与变化，\n人类的技术与文化，\n都在掩盖本应被大家知晓的真相。
Only the realm of ancient myth, tended by gods, untouched by humans, might let us perceive it.
只有古老神话的领域，\n在神灵守护中，未曾被人类触及，\n才得以让我们触碰到真实。
Do you not agree?
你觉得呢？
How disappointing, to dismiss it outright.
你竟然直接否定了这一切。
If you have no eye for truth, then we have nothing else to speak of.
既然你没有看清一切的眼光，\n那也就没什么可说的了。
Forgive me this act of passion, but I expect a titan’s wrath may settle my raging heart.
请原谅我的情绪波动，\n但巨人的愤怒将会抚平这一切。
Regirock, heed my command.
雷吉洛克，听我号令。
To the contrary: it has adamant support, if only one ruminates on the matter.
只要人们肯深入思考，\n就会发现这一切是对的。
Such wavering faith is nigh-useless for my purposes, alas. We require unflinching devotion.
但这种满是动摇的信仰\n对我的目的没有任何作用，\n我们需要更加坚定的信念。
*sigh* I would be forsaking my duty if I did not stall you at the least. Prepare yourself.
*轻笑声*为了履行我的职责，\n起码要拖延你前进的进程。\n做好准备吧！
I should encourage you to do so. Judge the weight of the world that is against the world that could be.
我很高兴你愿意这样做，\n去评估世界的重量，\n对比真实与虚伪。
Alas, I know you will not ruminate idly upon it. You are a threat. That is intolerable to us.
但我不会就这样等着，\n现在的你仍是威胁，\n我们无法容忍的威胁。
This shall be no decisive victory of mine, but I cannot let you pass unhindered.
我知道想要赢你并不容易，\n但也不能让你轻松通过这里。
…I should very much like to believe you.
...我也很希望能相信你。
If you speak truth, then I bid you repeat your convictions to Yezera herself next you meet.
如果你真是这样想的，\n那下次见到叶泽拉时，\n请重复你刚才的想法。
She can see the machinations of your heart more clearly than I. Until then, you remain a trainer, as do I.
她比我更擅长\n看清别人内心的阴谋，\n但现在我们仍然是对手。
My enemy I smite, my ally I train. To either, en garde.
而对手，就是要击败的。
If you will not listen to my entreaties, then you are beyond salvation.
连最基本的倾听都不愿意，\n也就代表你已经无药可救了。
Alas. Perhaps a titan’s fury will enlighten you to the clarity of the ancients.
唉，或许巨人的怒火，\n能让你清晰地认识到这一切。
G’afternoon. Took your sweet time showing your face ‘round these parts, didn’t ya?
下午好，没想到你现在才赶到这里。
Listen, I ain’t ‘bout to preach to ya. Just want to make some things clear ‘fore we fight.
首先，我并不是想说教，\n只是希望能在战斗前澄清一些事情。
‘Cause we’re gonna fight. Ain’t no other way to it.
虽然无论如何都得打这一架...
Thank you kindly. I ain’t real interested in this cloak- and-dagger charade.
非常感谢，其实...\n我并不喜欢这种装扮...
I’m with Yezera, always.
我只是一直在帮叶泽拉做事。
Listen, I’m only gonna say this once: you oughta hear her out.
注意，我只说一次：\n你应该去听听她的意见。
Don’t care if you agree with her. Just hear her out.
无论你是否认可她的想法，\n只是去听听，应该不难吧。
And if you hurt her, I’ll make you wish Mavis stopped after Zain. We clear?
但是如果你伤害到她，\n我会让你输给赞恩的，明白了吗？
Cocky li’l brat, ain’t ya? Tsk.
真是个自大的家伙。
What’s so damn infuriating ‘bout you is I ain’t just able to whip your sorry hide into submission. Too good.
然而让我不爽的是，\n我没办法轻松击败你，\n你的确有些实力。
How ‘bout I try anyhow? Titan’s gotta be good for somethin’, right?
所以就来试试吧，\n看看巨人拥有怎样的力量。
Good. I ain’t ‘bout ta repeat myself.
好的，我不想重复自己的话。
Now, I came here with a job to do, and I’m a reliable sort.
现在，作为一个可靠的同伴，\n我还是得完成自己的任务。
Sorry, kid. You’re a mite too fast. Gotta slow you down. Regirock, lead us off, will ya darlin’?
抱歉了，孩子。\n你的进度太快了，\n我得让你放慢一些脚步。\n上吧，雷吉洛克！
Hah. Take it from someone who knows, kid: you ain’t even scratched the surface.
哈，我只能以我的经验告诉你，\n你甚至连表面都还未触及到。
I can make you plenty more miserable if I set my mind to it.
只要我想，我还能继续拖你的时间。
But, cheer up, kid. I’m ‘bout to give ya what you always want: a good fight. Facing a Regi oughta cheer ya up. Heh.
不过，你应该想要\n一场优质的对局吧？\n面对雷吉洛克，\n或许能让你振奋起来。
Nah, I ain’t about to trust that. Ya don’t know jack about me and Yezera.
哼，我才不信这句话！\n你根本不了解我和叶泽拉的事。
Bickering old married couple, that’s what we are.
我们已经是经常拌嘴的老夫妻了。
Want to show me you’re with us? Tell it to Yezera.
如果要证明你的想法，\n那就把这些想法告诉她吧！
For now, I ain’t too keen on letting you off easy. Sorry. Beating folks into the dirt is my job, after all.
但现在，我不会让你轻易脱身的，\n将你打得落花流水就是我的工作。
Ah, well. Guess no matter how hard I try, old habits die hard.
呵，好吧，不管怎么努力，\n老习惯还是不肯消停啊。
Speaking of dying hard – lay down and quit moving, will ya?
说到这里...\n现在得请你消停一下了。
Hah. They ain’t never been happy with my way of goin’ about covert ops.
哈哈，他们也觉得\n我不擅长秘密行动。
Too rough ‘nd tumble. I ain’t built for cloak-and-dagger.
我行事太过直白粗暴。
So, let me tell you straight: you listen to Yezera. You hear her out. And don’t you dare hurt her.
所以，我就直白地告诉你了：\n去听取叶泽拉的意见，\n倾听她的想法，不许伤害她。
All I ask. And, uh, I wasn’t just sent here to chit-chat. You ready?
这就是我唯一的要求。\n当然我也不是来找你闲聊的，\n现在你准备好了吗？
Hey. Fancy meeting you in a place like this.
嘿，在这里相遇真是巧啊。
Oh, don’t look so angry – Regirock and I are here to fight you, but we’ll get to that.
哦，别动火啊，\n我和雷吉洛克就是\n为了打败你而来的，\n但我们会先说清楚状况。
I know you’re more than a pretty face. You’re smart. Care to hear me out?
我知道你不仅有好看的面容，\n还有着聪慧的大脑，\n所以能听我说完吗？
Aww. I knew I had a good feeling about you.
啊，我就知道你是个好人。
How do I explain it… well, I hate to use the word, but modern society is degenerate.
我该怎么解释呢…\n嗯...我不想用这个词，\n但现代社会的的确确是堕落的。
We’re distant from the perfect moment of creation. We’ve kind of taken over the world.
我们远离了神创造的完美世界，\n对一切掌握得过多了。
No respect for our elders – the primordial Pokémon that created the universe.
我们并没有给予\n创造宇宙的宝可梦足够的尊重。
Yezera’s going to reset this world back to its origins. And then humanity will be in the bosom of Arceus once more.
叶泽拉将会把一切回溯到起源，\n届时人类将再次\n回到阿尔宙斯的怀抱。
Don’t call me insane. Although I’m sure this arrogant, faithless civilization would use that term.
不许用这个词来称呼我，\n这是傲慢又没有信仰的文明\n才会用的堕落词汇！
I’m merely devout, and devotion means making sacrifices. For example: you.
我只是虔诚而已，\n虔诚即意味着做出牺牲。\n就好比：你。
I really do like you, but… we all have to sacrifice sometimes.
我真的很喜欢你，但是...\n牺牲是绝对不可避免的。
Godlike Pokémon are now treated as not much more than beasts of burden.
那些神明一般的宝可梦\n现在都被看作是牲畜一般。
Avatars are destroyed at will because they’re “threats to humans.”
化身被肆意地摧毁，\n就因为它们是“对人类的威胁”。
The world has lost all respect, the divine essence from creation diluted and destroyed.
这个世界已经毫无尊重可言，\n神圣的本质被稀释、破坏。
And since you seem to be no different, I can take some joy in this fight.
既然你也没什么不同，\n那就在这场战斗中获得一些乐趣吧。
Arceus created the world. It is pure, and perfect, and resetting the world back to its original form will let us be pure and perfect too.
阿尔宙斯创造了这个世界，\n它是最纯净、最完美的，\n而重置后的我们也会变得纯净和完美。
I’d like to see myself blessed by the grace of our creator.
我想要得到神的恩典与祝福。
I’d like to see you that way, too.
我希望你也能得到这些。
In time.
时间差不多了。
For now, I’ve been ordered to slow you down. Shall we dance?
我接到的命令是拖延你的时间，\n那么现在，我们开始跳舞吧？
Good. I knew I saw something in you.
很好，我知道你身上迸发出了什么。
Some spark of faith. I’m a… very good judge of character.
那是一些信仰的火花，\n而我是一个...善于识人的人。
I’d love to just talk with you for a while, but I was explicitly instructed to stop you. So we’ll fight. Don’t take it personally.
我很想和你多聊一会儿，\n但我的任务是要阻止你，\n所以我们还是要对决，\n这跟我个人的情感无关。
Oh. Was I too forward?
哦，我太直接了吗？
My emotions tend to get the better of me. I’m almost heartbroken.
我总是会被自己的情绪控制，\n我现在心都要碎了。
Well, I suppose I am a stranger.
也对，我现在是个陌生人。
Fortunately, I’ve been sent to slow you down, so I have a convenient vent for all these feelings of rejection.
好在我的任务就是来拖延你，\n眼前正好有一个方便的出气口，\n释放掉这些被拒绝的痛苦。
Hello, friend.
你好，朋友。
Business before pleasure: I have been sent to slow your progress.
我一直都是直来直往，\n我是来拖延你的进程的。
To that end, I am accompanied by a titan.
为此，我还带了一个巨人。
Before we attend to that, however, may I interest you in a short, frank discussion?
然而，在我们处理这个问题之前，\n可以先向你介绍一下我们的立场吗？
I would rather like to try to convince you of the legitimacy of our position.
我想试着说明我们的立场是正确的。
Thank you for your time.
感谢你的时间。
Yezera’s goal is to recreate the conditions of the world shortly following its creation.
叶泽拉的目标是\n重现世界诞生后不久的样子。
Modern science has attained almost complete understanding and mastery over the world – the modern world.
现代科学已经几乎\n完全理解和掌握了现在的这个世界。
It cannot, however, understand the past. By reverting existence, we may study the universe from its conception and obtain universal knowledge.
但是，却无法理解过去。\n通过回到过去，\n我们就可以研究宇宙开始的概念，\n并获得宝贵的知识。
This is the only way to do so.
这是唯一的方法。
Without the reversion, humanity will never attain complete understanding of the universe. It is worth all prices.
如果不这么做，\n人类将永远无法理解宇宙，\n这些代价是值得的。
Now our time for conversation is up, however. Regirock, please do the honors.
现在，交流时间结束，\n雷吉洛克，开始行动。
All persons who attempt to advance civilization should care.
所有试图让文明\n得以推进的人都应该关心。
Universal knowledge is a prerequisite for an all- powerful society.
知识普及是使文明\n进入新时代的先决条件。
That is my goal. That is the goal of all science: to know, and to apply that knowledge.
这是我的目标，\n也是所有科学发展的目标：\n理解，并运用那些知识。
Your ignorance implies discussion will get us nowhere. Let us dispense with such, then.
你的无知也就代表着，\n我们的讨论不会有任何进展，\n那么就没有继续下去的必要了。
Knowledge will be retained into the new primordial era.
知识将被保留到新的原始时代。
We can rebuild at least small enclaves of humanity.
我们可以重建人类的小聚落。
From there our analysis and conquest will begin: a new society with absolute knowledge.
并以此为基准开始分析与征服，\n并发展为一个\n拥有绝对知识的新社会。
And, stemming from this absolute knowledge, absolute power.
同时，还会因为绝对的知识，\n拥有绝对的力量。
Consider it. In the mean time, there is the business I mentioned earlier. Excuse me.
考虑一下吧，与此同时，\n我也该执行接到的任务了。
I am glad you have the wisdom to agree. If you should wish to support us in our endeavors, I will be happy to have you.
我很高兴你拥有这份智慧，\n如果你愿意支持我们的事业，\n我很高兴能有你的加入。
We will fight for a more enlightened era. For now, however, I must slow you. Business is business. Let us commence.
我们将为一个更开明的时代而战，\n但现在，我必须阻止你。\n任务如此，让我们开始吧。
I find this highly unfortunate. You will be left behind by progress.
这并不是一个正确的选择，\n你将被进步抛在脑后。
If you would prefer to retain your ignorance, however, I cannot help you.
然而，既然你自愿保持无知，\n那我也无能为力。
Prepare yourself. Regirock, if you would.
准备好了吗？\n雷吉洛克，出击。
Oh. Hey.
嗨，你好。
Yeah, so, I knew you’d be here. Gym challenger, and, uh, all that.
哈哈，我知道你会来这里，\n道馆的挑战者...等下！
…Welp. This is awkward.
…唔，有点尴尬。
How do I say this… you interested in hearing us out?
我该怎么说呢…\n你有兴趣听听我们的想法吗？
We’ve kinda got the upper hand, but, y’know, don’t really wanna fight you. Whaddya say?
我们现在可是占上风了，\n但是...你应该明白，\n我们不想与你敌对，你觉得呢？
Oh. That’s good. Great. Honestly didn’t expect that.
哦，那太好了！\n真的没想到...
Well, I just figure we’ve done a lot of ordering Pokémon around.
我只是觉得我们不应该\n将那么多命令强加给宝可梦。
Maybe it’s time to even up the footing a bit, y’know?
也许是时候让我们\n站在同样的地位上了，大概...
We can all kinda make up for whatever we did wrong.
我们有机会弥补以前所犯的错误。
The others have their reasons, but, uh, this is mine. Make a world where we can be forgiven. You get it?
其他人有他们自己的理由，\n但...呃...这是我的理由。\n创造一个我们可以被原谅的世界，\n你能理解我的意思吗？
Well – fine. You know what? Fine.
好吧...你有自己的想法。
I don’t need your permission, and we certainly don’t need your help. Regirock. Do ‘em in.
当然，我不需要你的认可，\n也不需要你的帮助，\n雷吉洛克，干掉他。
…You so sure? Takes a lot of pushing to train a team that strong in so little time.
...你确定？\n这么短的时间内\n训练出这么多强大的宝可梦，\n这得需要多大的压力啊！
But, yeah, no, I get it. Why would you help us?
但是，啊...我明白了，\n你并没有帮助我们的理由。
Rich brat. Maybe we can beat some responsibility into you.
毕竟你是个富家子弟，\n你应该承担起更多责任。
Uh. Don’t really know how to break it to you. You… don’t have time.
嗯，我不知道该怎么说...\n你...没有思考的时间了。
For one, we’ve already just about won. For two – think fast!
首先，我们已经快成功了，\n其次...我还有自己的任务。
Regirock, sweep ‘em off their feet!
雷吉洛克，把他解决掉吧！
Oh. Didn’t, uh, really expect that.
哦，没想到会这样。
Figured you were kind of a stuck-up brat. No offense.
我本以为你就是个\n自大的富家子弟...\n抱歉，请不要介意。
Well, good. Maybe we’ll be side by side one day, yeah?
好吧，也许有一天，\n我们会并肩作战，对吧？
But, uh, for now… I’m supposed to fight you.
但是，现在...\n我应该和你战斗。
So, uh, sorry – ah, what am I saying, we live for this. Ready up.
所以，抱歉...\n啊，我在说什么，都到这一步了...\n准备好了吗？
Yeah, I guess that tracks.
哈，我觉得也会是这样。
Fine. That’s… it’s fine.
好吧，没关系。
I came here to beat the crap out of you anyways.
我来这里就是为了揍你一顿的。
Odds are Regirock isn’t gonna stick around much longer, so let’s make it count. Try your best, eh?
雷吉洛克很快就要离开了，\n所以我要尽可能地利用好它。
…Hey.
嘿。
Tsk tsk tsk. I’m not gonna lie to you: I’ve been trying to plan this conversation in my head for the past hour.
呃...这个...我不会骗你：\n我已经在脑海中\n将这次谈话了预演一个小时了。
But, um, you kinda interrupted me. So can I just say what I want to tell you?
但是，嗯...思路断了...\n对，我能说一些\n我想告诉你的东西吗？
Welp. Listen, uh, Makya’s kinda in a weird place right now.
嗯...差不多...呃...\n马凯亚现在的情况很糟糕。
Team Chasm ran roughshod over this whole region and then kinda just… got away with it?
之前裂隙队在这里到处肆虐，\n然后就这样...撂挑子走了？
So, uh, yeah, if you ever wanted proof that humans can’t get even the most black-and-white justice right, there you are.
所以，这就是人类\n甚至连正确分辨是非善恶\n都做不到的最直接的证据。
Would’ve been simple to fix that little screw-up. But they didn’t.
本来很容易就能处理这些问题的，\n但他们没有这样做。
So we’re taking the power away from humans, and putting it in the hands of Pokémon.
所以我们要把权力\n从人类手中夺走，\n交到宝可梦手中。
Is it? Is it!
啊？这就是答案吗？
Am I insane for wanting some damn PUNISHMENT in this world?!
我就是希望他们\n得到应有的正义审判，\n是我的问题吗？
Well, guess what. If people won’t give me it, I’ll MAKE it.
行，无所谓了，\n既然大家不愿这么做，\n那我就自己去审判。
And I’ve got just the tool!
而我有很好的帮手！
It is simple, you – you idiot!
这明明很简单，你...你个白痴！
I can track down every ex-Chasm criminal and haul them up to the courts myself if I have to!
只要想这么办，\n我可以把每个裂隙队成员，\n亲自拖到法庭上受审。
They just won’t do anything if I did! So I have to do things personally, yeah?
但他们什么都没有做！\n所以我必须亲自去做这一切！
Sorry. Nothing… personal.
抱歉，这不是个人恩怨。
Yes!
没错！
They’re noble and pure and – and – and they’d never let me down!
他们高贵而纯洁...\n他们永远不会让我失望！
Unlike you! And everyone else around here!
不像你！\n还有你周围的每个人！
You want to see? C’mon. See what kind of justice Pokémon can give!
要见识一下吗？\n看看宝可梦能给出什么样的正义吧！
Oh. Ah-hah.
哦，啊哈。
Kinda got myself a bit worked up there… welp, no harm, no foul, yeah?
咳咳...有点激动…\n不过无伤大雅。
…Nah, that’s stupid.
…不，还是丢脸...
I’m not gonna waste this chance. I’ve got a Regi. You’re a prodigy. Let’s RUMBLE!
无论如何，我不会浪费这个机会，\n毕竟手里有一个巨人，\n我们来战吧！
Urgh, you make me so mad!
你让我很生气！
Nobody will frickin’ listen to me!
没人听我说话！
Fine.
好吧。
Y’know, fine, whatever.
好吧，随你便。
You get what everyone else I fight gets. What you deserve.
你会在我这里品尝到应有的失败！
Regirock – your watch is over. If you would go, then go.
雷吉洛克，你的任务结束了，\n你可以凭自己的意愿离开了。
So it returns to its resting place… no matter. It has done all I desired and more.
它现在回自己的安息之地了...\n但它已经超额完成了我的目的。
As for you, we shall meet again.
至于你，我们会再见面的。
Farewell, and do not pursue me. Fate and fate alone will dictate when we next speak.
再见了，不要跟过来。\n命运将会决定我们何时再相见。
Regirock’s damn well spent. Flighty li'l things never like to be outside their tombs too long.
雷吉洛克的任务结束了，\n这东西并不喜欢在墓穴外待太久。
Ah, well. Got what I came for anyhow.
反正我已经得到自己想要的了。
Let me tell you one last word of advice. You hurt Yez, I’ll find you. And it won’t just be for some play fight with animals.
最后再给你一句忠告，\n如果你伤害了叶泽拉，\n我会立即来收拾你。
G’evening, kid. I’ll see ya around. Make sure I don’t hafta hurt you too bad when I do, ‘kay?
晚安，孩子，我们还会再见的，\n当我们再见时，希望不是\n你让我怒不可遏的时候，好吗？
Au revoir, Regirock. Enjoy your entombment, I suppose.
再见了，雷吉洛克，\n享受你的安宁吧。
And as for you, that was an exciting fight. You’ve got my heart pounding.
这真是一场激动人心的战斗，\n你让我感到心跳加速了。
If you want to join us, come find Yezera. And if not, well, we’ll meet again. I’m looking forward to it already.
如果你想加入我们，\n就来找叶泽拉吧。\n即便不想，我们也会再相遇。
So long.
再见。
I surmise Regirock will now return to its tomb.
我想雷吉洛克应该\n回它的墓穴里面去了。
The titans are temperamental and ill-suited to existence outside their crypts. It is of no matter.
巨人们的情况很特别，\n不能长时间待在墓穴外，\n不过这不重要。
We have all but succeeded in our plans. This was a courtesy.
我们的计划已经成功了。
I will take my leave now. Thank you for your time.
我现在要走了，谢谢你的时间。
There it goes. Back to where it came from.
它走了，回它来的地方了。
Well, didn’t really expect to win anyways. Just wanted to slow you down, and, uh, I did.
嗯，我本来就没指望能赢，\n只是想拖延你的时间而已，\n并且也做到了。
So… bye. We’ll do this again sometime. I’m out.
那么...再见。\n希望我们有机会能再来一次。
*sigh* Buh-bye, Regirock. We don’t really, uh, need you anymore, I guess.
*叹气*再见了，瑞吉洛克，\n我想你可以回去了。
It was fun while it lasted… welp. Nothing lasts forever.
很有趣的一段经历...\n好吧，没有什么是永恒的。
Speaking of! Hopefully next time we talk it’ll be in a fair world!
希望下次，我们能\n在一个公平的世界里交谈！
If it isn’t, then, uh, I’ll give you a run for your money, ‘kay?
如果不是的话...那么...大概...\n我会让你付出代价的。
Toodles. And don’t you dare follow – I’m playing hard to get, so respect it. Hah!
再见了，不要试图跟着我...\n请尊重我不想暴露身份的意愿，哈！
More than a million years ago, a meteor struck this area of Makya, plowing through a large mountain to the west.
百万年前，有颗陨石从天而降，\n撞上了马凯亚的一座大山。
That large mountain became two smaller mountains, which we now know as Split Peaks.
巨大的冲击力将其一分为二，\n我们现在管那里叫嵌口峰。
The impact site itself would fill with water and become Sweetrock Harbor.
而被直接撞击的地方，\n则逐渐被海水灌满，\n并变成了今天的蜜岩港。
The ocean to the east brings calming winds.
宁静的海风从东边吹来。
But why? We might explain it with ocean currents, or weather patterns.
但这究竟是为什么呢？\n根据气候和洋流\n我们能得知风向的成因。
But what makes the winds here calming? Of that, I am not so sure.
但究竟是什么原因，\n让这里的海风变得如此宁静呢？
I really want to know who that was in the weird outfit.
我很好奇那些\n奇装异服的家伙到底是什么人。
Well, regardless, thanks for kicking them out of town.
总之，谢谢你帮我们\n把他从这里赶走了。
I'm a firefighter, so I'm used to dealing with issues...
我是一名消防员，\n我习惯地帮大家处理问题...

I've been biking across the entire region over the past few months.
我花了几个月的时间，\n靠骑自行车走遍整个马凯亚。
Crossing the Split Peaks was by far the hardest part.
其中最难的部分就是嵌口峰。
The view from these cliffs, and the feeling that I've finally accomplished my goal, made it all worth it.
但当我从悬崖上眺望远方，\n将一切尽收眼底的那一刻，\n感觉一切努力都是值得的。

我像这里的很多人一样，\n在蜜岩糖果工厂工作。
That said, I rarely get to see Victoire, the manager and gym leader.
但是我很少见到老板，\n也就是道馆馆主薇克特尔。
I gotta rely on rumors to know what her team is like.
连我都只能通过传言\n来了解她所拥有的宝可梦。
Some of them are a bit hard to believe.
其中一些流言让人觉得离谱。
I heard some people saying that she uses a Rainstorm strategy.
比方有人曾经说，\n她用的是“暴雨策略”。
With Fairy and Steel-type Pokemon? How does she manage that?
可是妖精和钢属性的宝可梦，\n怎么用所谓的“暴雨策略”？
Huh, you really beat her, then?
哇，你打败她了？
You gotta tell me what she's like as a trainer.
你能告诉我她的水平怎么样吗？
My curiosity's grown too big!
我可太好奇了！
Sweetrock Candy is sent all over the world, but more than 30% ends up in the Galar Region.
蜜岩港的糖果被运往世界各地，\n其中30%以上都流向了伽勒尔地区。

I've purchased a Clefable teleportation license, and reserved this pier for our use.
我们已经购买了皮皮传送执照，\n并租借了码头的使用权。
We can travel to and from any of our usual locations.
这样我们就可以\n快速往返于一些地点了。
Where will we be heading?
我们要去哪儿？
Have you slid down the conveyer belts?
你从传送带上滑下来过吗？
Preeeety sure we're not allowed to, but its crazy fun.
当然这样做很危险，\n但也很好玩。
Maybe not as fun as beating the 7th gym will be, since I got a reason to use another Makyan exclusive 'mon!
不过还是去挑战第七个道馆更有趣，\n毕竟我已经拿到了\n马凯亚的专属宝可梦！
Which one? You'll just have to battle me to find out!
哪一种？打过就知道了！
I cannot convey to you just how much I want to battle. Heh. So, you up to doing so?
我都不知道该如何表达\n现在对战斗的渴望，\n所以，你准备好了吗？
Understood.
知道了。
I'll be here until you wish to battle.
你准备好了就来找我吧。
Rock 'Em, Torterra!
去吧，土台龟！
Damn, even the Dustox couldn't leave a dent in you.
唉，即便是毒粉蛾\n也没办法伤到你。
Think anyone in the lighthouse was watching our battle just now?
你觉得灯塔上的人\n会不会看到我们刚才的对决呢？
No way around it, I'll need some healing before we square off again.
没办法了，下次交手之前，\n还是先恢复下状态吧。
Got a good look at Victoire, I take it?
你见到薇克特尔了对吧？
She as quirky as they say? I don't know why I bother asking. I'll be finding out soon myself.
她真的像别人说的那样奇怪吗？\n诶...明明我马上也要见到了，\n为什么现在还要多问一句。

[Map218]
A cap of rock is holding back a geyser of boiling water.
一块巨石堵住了沸腾的水。
I was once considered a beauty, but the way of the water needed a disciple.
尽管我拥有着俊朗的相貌，\n但从水之道也需要虔诚的心。
I should dry off.
现在得擦干了。
Legends say if I stay here for fourty day and nights, my inner qi will strengthen tenfold.
只要在这里住上七七四十九天，\n我的内功就能增强十倍。
The way of the water is full of solice. Splash.
水之道，无常形，\n滋万物，润无声。
\PN! You made it. Took some effort to find this place but... man. It was worth it.
\PN，你来了！\n虽说费了不少功夫才来到这里，\n但...一切都值得。
What? My all-grown-up companion here? Yeah. It is.
什么？你说它？\n没错，只不过成年了而已。
Sorry. Well, not sorry. You didn’t have to come. But you did. And I’m glad you did.
抱歉...其实也没必要。\n你其实不用来这里的，\n但我很高兴你来了。
I think it’s soothing. I dunno, maybe I’m just a little more goth than I’d like to admit.
我倒是觉得这里很舒服，\n或许我比想象中更喜欢黑暗？
The waters here are special. Not just ice-cold and way too deep for me to be comfortable, but they’re saltwater, too.
这里的水很特别，\n又冷又深，而且还是咸水。
Ocean water, trapped down here. And for some reason... it makes Phione transform into Manaphy.
或许就是因为这些\n被困在这里面的海水，\n才让霏欧纳变成玛纳霏了吧。
I don’t know why, or how. I’m not that smart. But it does.
我不知道是怎么回事，\n我本来就没那么聪明，\n只知道事实就是如此。
I don’t even know if it’s really evolution. It’s – I don’t care. I don’t care how it works, or what it is scientifically.
我也不知道这该不该算进化，\n反正我不在乎在科学上该怎么解释。
It’s a Manaphy now. And I’m damn proud of it.
重要的是它没事了，\n而且现在是玛纳霏了。
Yeah! I mean, I think so, at least.
对，我就是这样想的。
I can’t believe it. A Pokémon of actual literal myth and legends, here beside me.
我简直不敢相信，\n自己能得到一只真正的\n传说中的宝可梦。
Oh. Uh, yeah, thanks.
嗯，谢谢。
Um. I didn’t really have a lot to do with it. Phione came down here, danced around in the water here, and then it just kinda... transformed.
其实我并没有参与太多，\n霏欧纳来到这里后，\n就开始在水中跳舞，然后就这样了。
Unbelievable. A Manaphy. I raised a Pokémon like this, all by myself.
我真的很难想象，\n自己竟然抚养了一只这样的宝可梦。
It’s a Pokémon from myth. Supposedly they live at the ocean floor and can befriend anything and anyone.
那时一种传说中的宝可梦，\n据说生活在海底，\n并且可以和任何事物交朋友。
They’re not half-bad in a scrap, either. Truly just... amazing. An absolutely incredible Pokémon.
而且它们也很擅长战斗，\n真是神奇到令人难以置信的宝可梦。
And it’s my best friend. It doesn’t hate me, or resent me, or fear me. It chose to be with me, of all people.
最重要的是，它是我最好的朋友，\n它不讨厌我，不恨我，不怕我。
It could’ve chosen anyone. It could’ve chosen you – you’re certainly a better trainer than I am.
它明明可以选择任何人，\n比如说你，你肯定比我更好...\n但它最终还是愿意跟我一起。
And, yeah, thank you, sincerely, for everything. You’re great. And you’ve really helped me. Thanks.
最后...真的...非常感谢你，\n这一路上你帮了我太多。
Hmm. Yeah, not good enough. Gonna need one last favor.
嗯...不过...我现在还有个请求。
I hope so! Not too many people have even seen one of these magical things. And fewer people have fought one.
我希望如此！\n另外...见过传说中宝可梦的人很少，\n跟它们战斗过的更是。
Oh, we’re on the same wavelength. You know what it means.
哦，我想我们想到一处去了。
That’s right. One last showdown. You and me. My new Manaphy.
没错，最后一次决斗，\n你和我，还有我的玛纳霏。
I’m gonna lose, I know. But I’m not going down easy, alright? You ready?
我知道我会输，\n但我不会轻易放弃，\n你准备好了吗？
Alright. Get ready. I want it to be a good one.
好的，准备好再来找我吧，\n我不希望留下任何遗憾。
I’ve never been happier to throw down against anyone.
我从来没有像现在这样\n期待与某个人决斗过。
Manaphy’s debut. I don’t care if it’s good or bad. I just want to see it in action. Let’s do this.
玛纳霏的首秀...\n我不在乎它能不能表现好，\n我只想看到它战斗时的身姿，\n让我们开始吧。
You good? I’m ready when you are.
你准备好了吗？\n我随时都可以。
Ah, wouldn’t have it any other way.
啊，看来就到此为止了。
You know, \PN, you’re a good friend. You don’t pull any punches.
\PN，我一直将你当成朋友，\n你从不掩饰自己的想法。
I never could beat you, and I’m never going to, but that’s OK.
我从来没有打败过你，\n或许永远也做不到，但没关系。
You’ve made me better. Helped me out. I hope I’ve helped you too. I really do.
因为你让我变得更好了，\n你帮了我很多，\n我也希望能帮到你。
And, uh, yeah, I’m glad I met you.
能够与你相识真是件幸运的事。
Good. I’m – yeah, that’s all I’ve ever really wanted. Manaphy’s happy, you’re happy, I’m happy.
这就是我一直想得到的，\n你，我，还有玛纳霏，\n我们都很庆幸这段旅程。
Sorry, that’s just who I am. Big ol’ bleeding-heart, I guess.
抱歉，我一直都是这样，\n情感一直是我的第一驱动力。
Oh!
哦
Uh, well... I don’t know. I’ll think about it, OK?
呃...这...\n我不知道，我得考虑一下。
We’ll see each other around. I, uh... I dunno if I see you in that way.
我们还会再见的，\n我...嗯...我不知道再见时\n是否还可以像今天这样。
You know. If you’re saying what I think you’re saying.
我想你应该知道我的意思...
...\PN, I really do care about you, though. You’re my friend.
...\PN，我真的很在乎你这个朋友。
And if you need me, I’ll be there, always.
如果你需要我，我会一直在这里。
Well, maybe not always. I’ve got my Pokémon to take care of. But you know what I mean.
好吧，也许不是一直，\n我还要照顾我的宝可梦，\n但大概就是这个意思吧。
I’ve done some stuff I’m not proud of.
我曾经做过一些让我觉得丢脸的事。
I’m gonna come clean: I’ve been working with Yezera on her plans for a while now.
我必须坦白：\n我和叶泽拉计划这些...\n已经有一段时间了。
Never felt like I was good enough. Didn’t feel like anyone was good enough for the love we got from our Pokémon. But maybe that was just me projecting.
我不觉得自己是个好人，\n我不觉得有人能配得上\n宝可梦对我们的爱，\n但...这只是我自己的一种偏执。
Maybe I’m the asshole, y’know? And I’ve known that forever – I’m not that stupid – but it takes a wake-up call to realize it. And this was it.
换句话说，我就是个混蛋！\n我其实知道...自己没那么蠢...\n但我需要有谁来提醒我该做什么。
So, yeah, if they want to ruin the world, they can do it without me. And you can stop them with a Phione at your side. Or a Manaphy now, I guess.
所以，如果他们要毁掉这个世界，\n根本没必要来找我。\n并且，你可以和霏欧纳...\n或者玛纳霏一起去阻止他们。
I’ll be thinking about you. Wishing you the best, now and forever.
我会以我的信念，\n祝愿你能够成功。
Thanks for all of it. If you need me, ever, all you gotta do is ask.
感谢你做的一切，\n如果你需要我的帮助，\n随时都可以来找我。
Neither of us is finished, I know that.
我们还没有结束这一切。
I’m gonna try again at becoming Champion next year, I think. Maybe.
或许，明年我会试着，\n成为这里的冠军？
Future’s uncertain. And you... you’ve got stuff to do, I know.
毕竟未来谁也说不准，\n你也有一定要去做的事不是吗？
I wish you the best. I’m gonna be thinking about you, I know.
我会以我的信念，\n祝愿你能够成功。
And if you need me, you damn well better ask me, OK? You’ve taken a weight off my shoulders.
感谢你做的一切，\n如果你需要我的帮助，\n随时都可以来找我。
See you around, \PN.
再见，\PN。
Is that...?
那是...
Tell me about it.
跟我说明一下
Creepy, isn't it?
这里有些恐怖
That's great.
这样就够了
I'm proud of you.
太好了

这里的气氛已经平静下来了，\n那我也该走了。

Ah, hello. It’s good to see you again.
嘿，我们又见面了。
Do not fear: I have no new forms that need combat testing.
别担心，这次我并不大打算\n再做新的宝可梦测试。
I am studying the biodiversity of Prizca’s underground. It’s...
我正在研究宏礼市下水道内的\n生物群系，只是...
That’s not inaccurate. The ecological pressures here are novel, to say the least.
这样说也没什么问题，\n这里的生存压力出乎预料地大。
I am a biologist. We are accustomed to filth.
我作为一名生物学研究者，\n早已经习惯这种环境了。
If one has an aversion to creatures adapting to life in a sepulcher, then yes.
对于生活在城市中的一般人来说，\n的确是这样。
Perhaps to a trainer. After all, you can catch your preferred selection here just as easily as in the open wilderness, can you not?
或许对于训练家来说是这样，\n毕竟这里跟其他地方一样，\n给你提供了很多可捕捉的宝可梦。
In any case, it is an understudied biome.
总之，这里拥有着\n人们对其了解甚少的生物群系。
I had rather hoped to find it in pristine condition – as much as a sewer can be pristine – but the avatars have made that difficult.
我本希望能看到这里原本的样子...\n不过排水设施的存在也让它原始不了。\n但最大的问题还是这里的化身。
This entire region is undergoing dramatic ecological shifts. I have my concerns.
这个地区正在经历剧烈的变化，\n我对此感到有些担忧。
Yes. While avatars do not seem to eat or drink, and they do not prey upon other Pokémon, wild Pokémon still avoid them.
没错，虽然化身不需要进食，\n但它们的进攻欲望实在是太强了，\n野生宝可梦都会主动远离它们。
They are, after all, quite large and threatening.
单是那庞大的身形，\n就已经是一种威胁了。
I noticed a lack of avatars when I went anywhere you’d been before. I thank you for that.
我也注意到了，\n但凡你去过的地方，化身就会消失，\n谢谢。
I fear a potential climate collapse. That is predicated on very unlikely outcomes, but it is still a sobering idea.
我担心会因为各种微不足道的原因\n导致这里的气候崩溃，\n虽然概率很低，但值得大家警醒。

I plan to... well, I plan to ask them about their observations.
我计划…嗯...\n询问下他们对相关内容的研究结果。
And I would also like to determine if they’ve been performing their due diligence. I have my suspicions about their overall effectiveness.
另外我也想确定他们是否尽职尽责，\n毕竟现在这样...很难不怀疑。
To say more at this point would be baseless slander.
当然，在只有猜测的情况下，\n我说得越多，就越是诽谤。
If you should happen to want to assist me, meet me there. In fact... I could use someone with a position of perceived competence with regards to battling.
如果你愿意帮我，\n就一起去大学吧...\n而且我也需要一个足够强的训练家。
Could you seek me out after finishing your gym challenge?
大概...就在你完成道馆挑战之后吧？
Between your eight badges and my eight-year degree, I believe our conclusions would demand respect.
凭我的八年学位和你的八个徽章，\n他们肯定不敢随意敷衍我们。
But, no, do not answer me. I have already imposed on you enough, so I’ll leave you be.
但是...不...算了。\n我已经给你添了太多麻烦，\n现在还是别再提出什么要求了。
Goodbye, traveler.
再见，旅行者。

We've racked up quite the collection of artifacts, though now that we're older in our years we're trying to find these items new homes.
年轻时积累了相当多的文物，\n虽然现在我们年纪大了，\n但依然在努力\n为这些物品寻找新的归宿。
They're not coming wherever we're going.
它们不会跟着我们离开这个世界。
Those fools over at Aegis Insurance called and tried to convince us to register for "adventuring insurance".
宙斯盾保险公司的\n那些蠢货们打电话过来，\n要我们买什么“冒险保险”。
A good idea on the surface, but the fine print restricted us from entering ancient tombs!
表面上看是在保障安全，\n但里面的条条框框，\n无一不是在限制我们的活动！
To think, that they would try and pull the wool over our eyes with that scam.
他们也太小瞧人了，\n还想用这种骗局来骗我们！
Clearly they have no respect for treasure hunters!
寻宝者打交道最多的就是骗子了！

I get lost in caves a good bit.
我经常在洞穴里迷路。
Working here has been a nightmare for me, I can never find the right way out of here.
这对在这里工作的人来说，\n简直就是一场噩梦。
Ya know, I heard that bat Pokemon are pretty good at remembering cave layouts. Something to do with echolocation.
我听说蝙蝠宝可梦很擅长这个，\n它们能利用回声探明洞穴的布局。
If you got one of those Pokemon, I can trade you a Pokemon of mine. A Dewpider, to be specific.
如果你有这样的宝可梦，\n我可以拿我的滴蛛跟你交换\n（在箱子里选择宝可梦）。
Maybe the Rangers might let me crash in their Station...
希望义军同意我\n在他们的营地里借住一晚…
Least that way I don't have to make the trip...
这样就不用走那么远了…
They can't be too hard to find right? We are in a cave after all.
应该不会很难找吧？\n毕竟我们现在就在洞里。
I'd go find one myself, but, well, it's a catch 22 of sorts...
我可以自己去找，\n但是这...对我来说有些麻烦…
Yes! A bat! Exactly what I wanted!
太好了，我要的就是这个！
Finally, the routes might start making sense.

An expensive kitchen set.

It's weird working back at the ol' Chasm base.
在以前的裂隙队基底工作，\n感觉真是别扭。
I never thought I'd see this place again once Helena set me up with a Ranger job.
自从那天海伦娜给了我\n这份属于义军的工作之后，\n没想到还会再看到这里。

Hey, Trainer. You look like the type that might want a starter.
嘿，训练家，\n我感觉你应该想要个初始宝可梦？
Digging is my passion, but I do a little bit of scalping on the side to get a little extra dough every month.
挖矿寻宝是我的兴趣，\n但同时也需要靠倒卖维持生活。
You interested in purchasing a Starter Token? There aren't many just floating around.
有兴趣买一个初行商店的代币吗？\n这东西可少见得很。
I'll give you one for the low, low price of $4000. How does that sound?
我不会出很高的价格，\n$4000，你觉得怎样？
Nah, nah I get it. Not everyone wants the easy street.
嗯，明白了，\n不是每个人都想走捷径。
Take some time to think about where your hard earned cash goes, no?
有时间就好好想想，\n辛苦赚来的钱要花在哪儿吧。
Looking good, looking good. That's the cash I needed.
很好很好，我们各取所需。

你想好要哪种代币了吗？
Sure, take all the time you need. I'm not going anywhere.

Gonna flex to your friends with it?

I was worried about my research funding when Team Chasm decided to go legit.
当我听说裂隙队要合法化时，\n我非常担心研究经费会不会断。
Turns out I didn't have to worry about anything. Being a research lead was enough for me to land a cushy job as the Ranger Captain here.
结果所有事情都有人处理完了，\n我作为研究主管，\n只要同时兼任义军队长的工作就行。
And research money is research money, doesn't really matter where it came from.

The island is a haven for 7 different lines of Dragons, serving to protect them from the greed of trainers.

You have endured many hardships in service of Makya, and thus have earned my confidence.
你为马凯亚做了这么多，历尽艰辛，\n所以我愿意信任你。

Greetings, fellow Master of Dragons.
你好，巨龙的伙伴。
Do you have more eggs which you wish me to hatch?

I can only promise results on problems that can be solved by early Makyan archaeology or a Garchomp… but that’s most problems.
我现在只能解决那些，\n早期马凯亚古物相关，\n以及像凶牙鲨那样暴力解决的问题...\n不过这好像已经包含大多数问题了。
Hah! I’ll see you, \PN.
哈哈！再见了，\PN。
Hello, \PN! It’s so good to see you again.
哦，\PN！很高兴再见面。
I can’t talk for long, I’m afraid. I’m getting a paper ready to publish.

It’s my first non-archaeological work – I’m tackling the age-old question of “what’s a Dragon?”
这是我第一次写非考古的文章，\n我正在解决“什么才算龙”\n这个古老而又悠久的问题。
Is Charizard a Dragon? What about Milotic? Or certain Exeggutor subspecies?
比如喷火龙，美纳斯，\n还有某种椰蛋树，这都是龙吗？
To put my findings succinctly, the only way to tell if something’s a Dragon is to hit it with an Outrage.
简而言之，我的研究是，\n要确定某种事物是否是龙，\n那就直接用发逆鳞打过去。
That, um, tends to solve the debate rather quickly.
这样...嗯...问题就解决了。

孵化
Yes, please.

No, I'll go myself.

Oh. Hello. You’ve caught me at the absolute worst time, you know?
哦，你好，真是不巧，\n你碰上我最忙的时候了。
I’m technically breaking and entering at the moment.
现在我们都算是非法闯入了。
This used to be a cozy little restaurant run by a friend.
这里以前是我一个朋友\n经营的小饭馆。
She bought the place, remodeled it so she could cook on the first floor and live on the second, and now it’s this.
她花钱买下了这里，并重新装修，\n一楼做饭，二楼住人...\n但现在却变成了这副模样。
Empty.
空荡荡的。
Oh, it’s not so bad. Everything has its season, and in Makya it’s barely summer a day before winter comes.
哈，其实也没那么糟，\n万物皆有时，而且在马凯亚，\n夏天刚开始，冬天就要来了。
Constant tumult, this region.
这个地区总是处于动荡之中。
I didn’t believe it at first. That she’d just up and leave.
曾经我是这里最受欢迎的常客，\n再加上我对锁头很在行。
I figured I was always welcome here anyways, and I know my way around a lock.
起初我并不相信她会突然离开。
Eternally, my savior.
放心，我不会忘的，我的恩人。
And if that flattery isn’t enough for you, I WAS trying to find another way to repay you.
如果只是恭维还不够的话，\n或许可以用另一种方式来报答你。
Unfortunately, dinner seems to be off the table… no pun intended.
但很遗憾，\n今天在这里的晚餐已经取消了...\n哈哈，开个玩笑。
Can you feel that, though? The stillness? I think we’re here for a reason.
我来这里自然还有其他原因，\n你能感觉到吗，这种寂静？
Let’s look upstairs. You first, though – something’s off, and you’re the brave warrior.
我们上楼去看看吧，\n你先走...虽然有点不对劲，\n但我相信你是勇敢的战士。
Not that I want you putting yourself in harm’s way on my behalf… but it would be rather gallant.
不是我想让你为了我而冒险…\n但这样做会显得相当勇敢。
Oh? I’ll refrain from reading too much into that.
我不会对此做过度解读的。
What I’m worried about is something a bit less fun.
我担心的是...\n一些不太有趣的事情。
Let’s check upstairs, and be ready. You might end up having to save me again.
我们去楼上看看吧，\n做好准备，也许你...\n又得救我一次了。
Am I really that one-note?
我真的那么单调吗？
I’ll have to try and be more creative in the future – I can’t stand being cliché.
我受不了那些陈词滥调...\n应该找个更有创意的方法。
To answer your question: I hope not, but there’s only one way to find out.
现在回答你的问题：\n我希望不是，但显然这最合理。
Shall we look upstairs? At your leisure, of course.
我们去楼上看看吧，\n当然，你随意。
Oh, no. I’m not going up there first. You’re the bold and brash one between us, aren’t you?
不，我不会先上去的。\n在我们两个之间，\n你才是那个大胆而鲁莽的人，对吧？
I'm sorry.
抱歉
Why are you here?
你为什么在这？
You owe me.
你欠我一个人情
Huh?
哈？
So do I.
点头
Avatar?
化身？
[Map255]
So it was an avatar after all. Two, in fact! How delightful!
果然是化身！而且有两个！\n简直是太美妙不过了！
Such grace, such magnificent power, such… oh, words fail me.
如此优雅又宏伟的力量...\n如此...哦，我不知道该怎么形容了。
But it is a little convenient, isn’t it? The two of us come here.
不过这正合适不是吗？\n是我们两个来到的这里。
I, the sensitive soul, the pilgrim, and you, the knight, the protector.
我，朝圣者，敏感的灵魂，\n还有你，骑士，守护之人。
And what should we find but a Gallade and a Gardevoir.
而且我们找到的正好是\n一个艾路雷朵和一个沙奈朵。
Maybe so, maybe not. In any case, I’m glad I had you walk upstairs first, and I hope you enjoyed the brawl.
或许吧，谁知道呢，\n不管怎样，很感谢你的骑士精神，\n也希望你能享受这场战斗。
I honestly envy you. You get to see these avatars up close and truly interact with them. All I can do is view them from afar.
我真的很羡慕你，\n你可以近距离看到这些化身，\n并与它们真正互动，\n而我只能从远处观看。
So it would seem. Appearing in the same biome as their regular counterparts makes sense at first glance.
看起来应该是这样的，\n即便有一定的生物群系影响。
But even that – how do they choose? Do they choose? Or are they pulled here by something?
可就算如此，它们又是怎么选择的？\n或者说它们做出主动选择了吗？\n还是被什么强行安排在这里的？
And if so, where were they before they were pulled here? If only I knew…
如果真是如此，\n那它们来到这里之前呢？\n又会在哪儿？如果知道就好了...
Perhaps I did. Not intentionally, but, well, maybe that’s how I view us. Relationship goals or something.
或许我只是无意中知道了，\n但...嗯...或许这只是我们的视角，\n强行将关系绑定上去而已。
And somehow that called them, or created them. If so, I’m deeply sorry – I didn’t intend for you to brawl on my behalf today.
至于说将它们召唤过来，\n或者说创造出来的方法，\n我很抱歉...我今天其实...\n真的没有让你为我而战的打算。
And thank you. If you hadn’t showed up, that Gallade might’ve decided I had one too many limbs.
不过还是要谢谢你，\n如果没有你，那只艾路雷朵\n或许会把我大卸八块的。
Oh, I can make up for this.
当然，我也有给你的补偿。
Well, what do I know – you probably think an opportunity to fight these things is a gift in itself.
好吧，或许这些不够...\n但你也可以将与它们\n战斗的机会本身视作一份礼物。
But in case that doesn’t count as me repaying you, have this back.
如果还不够的话我也没办法了，\n毕竟朝圣者身上的东西并不多。
It’s told me what I wanted to know – findings I’ll share with you sometime.
它告知了我想知道的东西\n - 我也会在某个时刻\n与你分享我的发现。
I also happened upon this by pure luck while exploring the deep marshes.
这是我在沼泽里找到的。
It isn’t much, but I want you to have it.
虽然不是很值钱，\n但我想将这个赠予你。
I know this wasn’t exactly what I promised, but I enjoyed it anyways.
我知道这不是一次完美的体验，\n但我还是很享受这次经历。
I hope you did too, and I’ll see you around. I’ll make it back to you. I promise. Until we meet again.
希望你也一样，\n我们还会再见的，保重。\n
Coincidence.
巧合
It isn't random?
不是随机的？
Did you call them?
你叫来的？
[Map256]
[Map257]
You... you're that Mavis kid, aren't you.
你...你就是那个叫梅维斯的孩子吧。
Pfft, some wannabe aristocrat you are. Old money? You don't even know the half of it.
呸，就你还想着当贵族，\n你连贵族的门槛都摸不到！
I offer you a deal, the location of my personal private island. Not my family's mind you, mine.
我跟你做笔交易怎么样？\n这是我私人岛屿的位置，\n不是我家人的，是我的。
I've never been to it, don't even know what's there. My great-grandmother's estate left it to me.
虽然我还没去过，\n甚至不知道那里有什么。\n我曾祖母去世后就是我的了。
If you'd like to go to it, simply beat me. It's not like I care what happens to it.
如果你想去看看，那就打败我吧，\n我不在乎那里变成什么样子。
THE SPIRITS HERE SCREAM!
这里的灵魂在尖叫！
PLEASE! IT IS TOO BRIGHT!
求求你！太亮了！
HELP ME, LAINIE! HELP ME!
救命，兰妮！救救我！
They can be bested, they can be bested, they can...
它们可以被打败，\n它们可以被打败，它们可以…
Bestie, it's time to invest in our stocks while they're low. We're accepting bestie buyouts!
姐妹，你看今天的股市了吗，\n是时候投资股市了！
Time to cash in on the best bonds... get my bestie estate in order...
该把那些债券变现了...\n该整理好我姐妹的遗产了...
Maybe it's time to invest in you stocks instead...
或许在你身上下注也不错...
Bestie, are you cheating? No...
姐妹，你是不是出轨了？
Good work bestie, we'll be rolling in bestie bucks if we invest in your bestie business right now.
干得漂亮，姐妹，\n如果我们现在投资姐妹股，\n那我们的姐妹资产就会滚滚而来。
Hey!
嘿
Hey hey hey hey!
嘿嘿嘿嘿！
OK, so, like, I know what you’re thinking: "Wow, Candy, you’re, like,
嘿嘿，大概...我知道你在想什么，\n比如“糖儿，你...大概...
super-cool for hanging out in such a super-cool place full of dangerous trainers." And, uh, yeah, thank you for noticing, I totally am.
在这样一个全是资深训练家的地方\n闲逛真是太酷了。”之类的想法，\n另外谢谢你注意到了，我的确很酷。
But I’ve got a reason, and it’s not even illegal!
但我有来这里的理由，\n而且这次不是非法的事情！
So, apparently Tamarind shows up in Whitebloom Town every few months to like check in or whatever, and I just did a li'l recon and...
塔玛琳每隔几个月都会来白花镇，\n进行检查或者做些其他什么...\n所以我稍微侦查了一下，然后...
OK, maybe it was actually a little illegal.
呃，好像还是有点违法。
No, shh, I can feel you, like, being judgy right now, and I totally don’t need that energy in my life right now.
别，嘘，我能感觉到，\n你...大概...在评判我，\n我现在完全不需要那种能量。
Because she’s the second-in-command of all Team Chasm! Like, duh!
因为她是裂隙队的二把手！\n大概...就这样！
She’s probably at the top of my hit list – I kinda forgot where I put it and now I can’t find it anymore but it’s almost 100 percent got her name in
她在我的名单上可是待了好久了...\n虽然我有点记不清名单在哪儿了，\n但我百分百确定她的名字在上面。
big letters at the top!
而且还是很大的篇幅！
Ugh, I can’t believe how on the same wavelength we are. You are like my buddy cop soulmate.
呃...我完全没想到，\n我们的思维方式如此一致，\n你就像是我的灵魂伴侣一般。
Oh, uh, yeah, sorry, hi, love you too. Cool?
哦...呃...对...那个...\n我也爱你，好吗？
Cool. Let’s talk about the interesting stuff!
我们还是来聊些有趣的事吧！
So, I broke into the abandoned lab and rooted around in there – which, it’s like mega-abandoned and super unsafe but, um, who cares – and found these.
我闯进了这里的废弃实验室，\n在那里找线索...的确那里已经...\n很不安全了，但是...嗯...我不在乎...\n然后就找到了这些。
Um, which is the part where I’d show you the stuff I’d found but I kinda shoved it in my backpack and that place is a total mess.
呃...的确我应该向你展示一下，\n但我把它塞进背包里了，\n那个地方又很乱。
So, uh, instead of digging it out, just take my word on it!
所以，嗯...我就不拿出来了，\n你只要相信我就好！
It’s this like dossier on a whole bunch of old Team Chasm operations that Tamarind must’ve left in there and forgot about!
那时以前裂隙队的一份行动档案，\n塔玛琳一定是把它忘在那里了。
Oh, all kinds of stuff with these, like, killer names.
嗯，上面有各种各样的，\n大概...像是杀手一样的名字。
Like “Operation Vagabond Plumage” or “Operation Cardinal Sin” or “Project Theodicy.” It gives me happy chills just thinking about it!
什么“流浪羽毛行动”、\n“红衣主教行动”或“神论项目”。\n想想这些就让我兴奋地发抖。
Yeah, but she’s like totally on that grindset 24/7 with running ex-Chasm stuff plus Professor work plus bureaucracy.
是啊，不过她应该是全年无休地\n忙着运营裂隙队的事情，\n还要做博士的工作，\n还要上下打通关系。
I knew she had to slip up eventually! Can’t just chug coffee forever!
就算是一直喝咖啡，\n她也迟早会失误的！
What? No! No way!
什么？不！不可能
OK, wait, like, maybe that’s a good idea?
诶，等下，大概...\n也许这是个好主意？
Like, if I’ve already got everything I need to know, I can totally get her to lower her guard by giving it back.
大概...既然我已经知道了\n我想知道的这些内容，\n那我完全可以这样来放松她的警惕。
Anyways, the main thing I actually, like,
总之，我实际上...大概...
care about is \nthis after-action report for something called “Project Testament.” Y’know how Velenz is, like, this total ghost town?
最关心这个叫“遗约计划”的报告，\n你知道夜幽市的事情吧，\n那里就跟个鬼城一样。
Well if I’m reading this right – and I had to look up a few words but I think I am – Team Chasm caused that!
如果我猜的没错的话...\n根据我得到的线索，没错...\n就是裂隙队导致的这一切！
They found some way to make avatars show up and secretly made them swarm the town, ‘cause apparently Velenz was super-resistant to helping.
他们一定是找到了某种方法，\n让化身出现并秘密地涌向城市，\n就因为夜幽市对他们的抵制。
Then they, like, intentionally lured avatars into the caves around there to mess up the foundations, and the whole thing started to sink into the mud!
然后他们故意诱导化身\n进入周围的洞穴里面，\n破坏一切，让建筑陷入泥潭中。
Seriously, it’s screwed-up!
这真是，太邪恶了！
Yeah! Like, this is the stuff Team Chasm did, and people are still, like, totally OK with them running around!
没错，大概...就是那个裂隙队干的，\n可人们却任凭他们四处乱跑。
Um... not completely sure, but I’m absolutely certain they did some evil stuff there, OK?
嗯...不是完全确定，\n但我他们肯定在那里\n做了很多邪恶的事情对吧？
I don’t know how they did it, or if the whole, uh, what was it called... “soil liquefication?”
我不知道他们是怎么做到的，\n那个...呃...叫什么来着...\n“土壤液化”？
Yeah, I dunno if that was intentional or not, but the report is pretty damn happy about it!
没错，我不知道他们究竟怎么想的，\n但他们显然对成果很满意！
I mean, like, kinda? The report doesn’t really get into the hows or whys that much, but, like, c’mon!
我觉得，大概...有点？\n报告上没有详细说明愿意之类的，\n但是...大概...总之！
If you don’t like these people, just, like, fight them? This is messed up.
因为不喜欢某些人就去攻击他们，\n这简直不可理喻。
No!
不！
No, no, no. No talking.
不，不，不，不要这样！
I know you’re friends with Tamarind, and, like, yeah, she did you a favor, and she’s cool. But this lady has done some evil stuff.
我知道你和塔玛琳是朋友，\n并且...大概...对，她帮过你，\n我也觉得她很酷，\n但她也的确做了很多邪恶的事情。
I’ve got a plan to confront her, and I want your help, alright?
我有一个解决这些问题的计划，\n而且需要你的帮助，所以？
Once the tournament is about to start, pretty much everybody is gonna be there, so there’s gonna be way less goons just out and about.
只要等到竞技大会开始，\n会有很多人聚在那边，\n外面就不会有多少走狗了。
I’ll send her an anonymous li’l letter – ooh, I can cut up the dossiers for letters and glue them together! That’s awesome!
然后我给她寄一封匿名信...\n对，我可以把档案的内容\n剪下来贴上去，这个想法真带感！
Anyways, yeah, send her a letter, tell her to come to the <imp>sewer maintenance building on the river banks</imp>. She’ll be there.
总之，我会给她写信，\n让她她到河边的<imp>下水道维护站</imp>去。\n她肯定会过去的。
Then you and me – we get some justice.
然后我们...就可以伸张正义了。
Alright? Alright! Great, cool, not gonna let you respond to that because honestly you can’t change my mind!
可以吗？可以的！\n没错，就这样！\n我不会给你拒绝的机会，\n而且你也改变不了我的想法！
You’re my friend and partner in crime and definitely not the minion of an evil mastermind! Toodles!
你是我的朋友，\n是正义的犯罪伙伴，\n绝对不是邪恶博士的手下，拜拜！
Hmph, a petty child comes to swing at their superiors. What arrogance.
哼，一个小屁孩居然敢跟\n自己的长辈交手，真是傲慢无礼。
This... proves nothing. A mere Pokemon battle cannot and will not close the continents of distance between our lines.
这...证明不了什么。\n一场宝可梦对决而已，\n这不会缩小我们之间的差距！
Well, if there is one thing the Mavis line is good for, it's savagery. Go on, get your little prize, I'm sure it costs more than mom makes in a decade.
果然，梅维斯最擅长的就是野蛮，\n快去拿你的小奖品吧，\n它抵得上你妈妈十年赚的钱。
What are you trying to talk to me for? Hoping that a shred of my nobility might rub off on you?
你别来跟我说话！\n想指望我的贵族气质能影响到你？
Look at yourself and tell me you'll be anything close to me. You'd be delusional to think so.
你自己照照镜子看看，\n你的气质能与我相提并论？\n简直痴心妄想。

…Are you bored yet?
…你无聊吗？
Of battling, I mean.
我是说战斗。
Only so many Pokémon, so many types, so many moves. Opponents become predictable. Easily manipulated.
宝可梦的种类就这么多，\n属性就这么几种，\n招式不过就一千多个。\n当了解这些后，\n对手就很容易战胜了。
I’m so… bored.
我…太无聊了。
You know how much I tried to fight it?
你知道我为了抵抗这种感觉\n付出了多少努力吗？
I set aside my entire team, trained a new one, and I was still bored. No one could even slow me down.
我一次次丢下之前的队伍，\n组建新的宝可梦队伍，\n但还是一样无聊，\n没有人能给我带来兴奋感。
So then I only used Bug-types. Only Fire-types. Only unevolved Pokémon. It just got worse.
然后我试着只使用虫系或火系，\n只使用未进化的宝可梦...\n结果只是越来越糟。
Everyone’s so predictable. They don’t understand Pokémon the way I do, fight the way I do.
每个人的心思都很好猜，\n他们不像我理解宝可梦，\n也没办法像我一样战斗。
I wandered all of Makya, catching only one Pokémon from each place I visited. Any time they failed me, I released them into the wild.
然后我试着漫游整个马凯亚，\n在每个地方只捕捉一只，\n并在它们让我失望时将其放生。
Even that grew old after a few months. The only person that’s broken up that boredom is… you.
几个月后...这也乏味了。\n唯一打破这种无聊的...是你。
So, \PN, I ask you: are you bored yet?
那么，\PN，我问你：\n你也已经厌倦了吗？
…Hmph.

…这可能不是你期望我说的话。
Did you want me to quiver and quaver like a child? Stumble over my words and beg for forgiveness?
你想让我像孩子一样\n颤抖和哭泣吗？\n希望我结巴着，乞求原谅？
Sorry. This is me.
对不起。这就是我。
This is the real me – the one I show to my Pokémon. The only ones I can truly talk to. And you.
这就是真正的我...\n向我的宝可梦所展示的我，\n你...是唯一真正可以交流的人。
All of this is going to be clean white stone in a little while. I wanted to come back just to see it one last time.
一切很快...就会变成洁白的石头，\n我想回来看看它最后一眼。
Couldn’t stand the idea of talking to anyone. Not Mom, not anyone. It won’t matter soon.
不用再强忍着跟任何人交谈，\n妈妈也是，其他人也是...\n很快就...都不重要了。

Yes. I am.
嗯，我知道。
Incapable of relating to humans, or even speaking to them.
无法与人类建立联系，\n甚至无法与他们交谈。
My heart races when they look at me. I am insane, or at least ill. But that doesn’t mean I’m wrong.
他们看着我时，我会心跳加速。\n我可能疯了，或者有病。\n但这并不代表我是错的。
I’d expect nothing less. You’re just like me when I was young.
我不奢望你能理解，\n你跟我年轻时一样。
Wanting to be good. So they’d love me…

You’ve seen the echoes of those primordial Pokémon. Soon, that’s what all Pokémon will become.
你已经看到了那些\n原始宝可梦的回响，\n很快，所有宝可梦都会变成那样。
No, not hostile.
不，它们不是敌对。
You’re so used to Pokémon being loving and subservient that it’s shocking to see them demand respect.
你太习惯宝可梦的顺从了，\n甚至因为它们对尊重的要求\n而感到惊讶。
They’re wild animals. Leave them alone.
它们本就是野生动物，\n不应该去打扰它们。
What about Rattata? What about Boltund? What about Venipede?
那么小拉达呢？\n那么电束木呢？\n那么百足蜈蚣呢？
Just another species. Not privileged. Not the center of the universe. Not anymore.

You ready?

Care to enjoy the view with me? It’s beautiful.

If we’re friends, you’ll fight me.

I – I… I care about you too.

I’m sorry. I’m sorry – just… just fight me.
对不起。\n对不起...只是...只是和我战斗。
Show me. It’s the only thing I know.
展示给我看。\n那是我唯一能懂的事情。
…Then watch as the world you know is erased.
…那就看着\n你所知道的世界被抹去吧。
It’s that simple.
就是这么简单。
Answer? No, of course not. You won’t stop me here.
答案？当然不是。\n你阻止不了我。
But it’s how we understand each other better. Show me who you are, \PN.
但这是我们能更好地\n理解彼此的方式，\n展示给我看你是谁，\PN。
Oh? You – you really think so? You’ve done so before.
哦？你...你真的这么认为吗？\n你以前也这样做过。
I’m sure you can. Just try. You’ve never let me down before.
我觉得你能做到。\n试试看，你以前从未让我失望过。
So, shall we dance?
那么，我们开始吧？
Regieleki, Regidrago, you can go now. Return to your tombs.
雷吉艾勒奇，雷吉铎拉戈，\n你们可以回到墓穴中了。
You’ll be unmade, too, once this is all done. Just like the eras you commemorate.
一旦这一切结束，\n你们也将被消灭，\n就像你们纪念的时代一样。
Do you understand now?
现在你明白了吗？
The real reason? Haven’t I given you enough?
真正的原因？\n我说的还不够吗？
A world of untapped potential! An end to the boredom! Freeing Pokémon from their saccharine subservience!
一个未被开发的有潜力的世界！\n不再无聊！解放宝可梦！\n让它们不再被奴役！
Fine. You want the real reason?
好吧...\n你想知道真正的原因吗？
…Not lying. I just haven’t told you everything.
…不是在撒谎。\n我只是没有告诉你全部。
To free their potential, to free them from humans, and to free… me.

…Always. Terrified. Not of any Pokémon, never in my life. But always of people.
…总是...害怕。\n不是害怕任何宝可梦，\n我这辈子从来没有过。\n但总是害怕人类。
That’s why I have to do this.
这就是为什么我必须这么做。
You don’t understand, \PN. If I was good with people like you, I wouldn’t be doing this. But I’m not.
你不明白，\PN。\n如果我像你一样擅长与人相处，\n我就不会这么做了，但我不行。
And you know what drives me mad? They should understand that! They should respect it! I saved this entire damn region! I’m a hero!
你知道什么让我发疯吗？\n他们应该明白！他们应该尊重！\n是我拯救了这个该死的地区！\n我是英雄！
And how am I repaid? With prying eyes and paparazzi.
而我得到的回报是窥探的目光\n和狗仔队的追逐。
I thought if I was good enough, they’d be kind to me. They’d understand me.
我曾以为如果我足够优秀，\n他们会对我友善，\n他们会理解我。
Well, I became Champion, and they still made me sick. The thought of having to talk to anyone still terrified me.
可我成为了冠军，\n他们还是让我感到恶心，\n我不想跟任何人交流，\n我害怕跟他们交流。
So I disappeared, and then the ennui came.
所以我就消失了，\n然后无聊降临了。
Enough. Enough! I deserve to be happy! I deserve to be at peace!
我受够了！够了！\n我应该得到快乐！\n我应该得到平静！
If I can’t talk to people, then I’ll create a world where people don’t rule. Where they don’t matter.
如果我不能和人交流，\n那我就会创造一个\n人类无法统治的世界。\n他们不重要！
Pokémon will rule, and I will understand them, and they will understand me.
宝可梦将会统治一切，\n我能理解它们，它们也能理解我。
I’ll be the shadow behind the throne, and I’ll – I’ll finally be happy!

You can never understand it – living in a world ruled by people you’re terrified of. People you can’t comprehend.
你永远无法理解...\n生活在一个由你害怕的人\n统治的世界里...\n周围都是无法理解的人。
I deserve some rest. I deserve some peace. And this is the only way I’m going to get it.
我应该得到休息，\n我应该得到平静，\n这是我唯一能得到的方式。
That’s the real reason. For me. So I can have a world where I belong.

Do you? Could you ever?

I deserve a chance at happiness. I never got one.
我应该有得到幸福的机会，\n我从未得到过。
Everyone else did. It’s only fair.
其他人都得到了，\n不公平。
Oh.
哦。
Oh… well, thank you. If only it changed anything.
哦...好吧，谢谢。\n但这并没有改变什么。
I do.
我必须。
Or I can remain in this world forever a stranger, wandering without a purpose.
不然我留在这个世界里，\n作为一个陌生人，\n漫无目的地徘徊吗？
Would you condemn me to that?
你会谴责我吗？
The Championship is getting close, you know.
竞技大会就要开始了。
I’ll wait for you. Once the Championship ends, I’ll make my preparations.
我会等你。\n结束后，我会做好准备。
You’ll find me in Regigigas’s chamber. If you decide you want to stop me or join me, meet me there.

And then we’ll settle things the only way we know how. It’s only right to give you one last fight.

Some others had the same idea, but we like to keep everything here on a need-to-know business.
虽然也有其他有同样的想法的人，\n但我们更希望能将技术掌握在手中。
It might be my lighthouse, but I sure as hell not gonna start a fight with who-knows-what for what amounts to mostly vacant space.
虽然这里是我的灯塔，\n但我也不希望在这里发生争执。
If you know what's good for you, you'll keep your head down and not talk to anyone.
所以希望你能对在这里看到的\n一些关键性的内容保密。
Anyways, I've got an issue for you to take care of. I'd do it myself, but, well, I suppose it's a bit beyond me.
说回整体，我有个任务要给你，\n我本以为能自己处理，\n但显然有些困难。
It's on an island far off the coast of Makya, so I'll have to have the Clefable send you over.
我们需要去马凯亚海外的一个岛上，\n所以我得让皮可西送你过去。
I can, uh, also send you the GPS coordinates. Got to meet the maid that drives your boat. Cool girl.
我可以把GPS坐标发给你，\n另外见见你那个很酷的开船女仆。
Anyways yeah. Talk to me again if you're ready to go.
等你准备好了再联系我。
So, uh, ready to head out?
所以，你准备好了？
I'd recommend taking your A-team as well. There's gonna be a bit more to worry about on your trip outside of turbulence.
我建议你带上自己最强的宝可梦，\n这次的旅程中会有很多挑战。
I've been here.
我来过
I haven't been here.
第一次来
I'm ready.
准备好了
Not yet.
再等等
[Map270]
Great, another Trainer, just what I needed.
太好了，又来一个，\n我刚好需要你这样的人。
You feeling up to fight avatars? Because I got a whole bunch of them right under me.
做好跟化身战斗的准备了吗？\n我这下面有一堆。
Dunno what put 'em there, but I need someone to go in and clean 'em out.
我也不知道他们是怎么出现的，\n但必须得有人去处理一下。
I've cleared at least a dozen of 'em by now, but the avatar of Diancie had to come and ruin my streak.
我已经清理了十几个了，\n但是蒂安希的化身断了我的连胜。
Gotta say, the news was right. Avatars are tough. Not even a former champ can reliably take 'em.
不得不说，新闻说的对，\n化身没那么好对付，\n即使是前冠军处理起来也有风险。
If you manage to get rid of it, we can talk after. You can keep whatever item it drops.
只要你击败它，\n就可以来找我拿点酬劳了。
Any luck down there?
进展如何？
No? Keep at it I guess.
毫无进展吗？\n看来得继续努力了。
So you managed to beat the Diancie avatar? Nice!
所以你打败了蒂安希的化身了？\n太好了！
Couldn't manage to do that myself. Most of my 'mons didn't have a great matchup against it.
靠我一人对付起来实在困难，\n我的大部分宝可梦都被它克制。
Say, my Pokemon are pretty rested now. I bet they'd be keen on having a battle with the team that took out the Diancie avatar.
说起来，我的宝可梦已经休息好了，\n我想它们很乐意\n与能打败蒂安希化身的你战斗。
How 'bout it yeah? Come back when you get rested yourself. Not every day a former champion wants to battle you.
怎么样？你休息好了就来一场吧，\n前冠军可不是每天都能遇到的。
You ready for a match?
你准备好战斗了吗？
Yeah, sounds good. Whenever is fine.
没问题，随时都可以。
Hah, you've got me pumped for this.
哈哈，你让我兴奋起来了。
Well, well, ain't that something?
没错，没错，\n这种感觉真好！
You're pretty damn good, I'll give you that. Beating me and that Diancie is impressive.
我必须承认，你真的很厉害，\n无论是打败我还是那只蒂安希，\n都是非常了不起的成就。
Might have to call the others warning them that someone might be trying to be the undisputed best.
看来我得警告下某些人，\n现在有个正试图\n成为最强训练家的新人出现了。
If you haven't done so already, you can find your next fight in Prizca, at the Ironclad Dojo. Trainer by the name of Scilla, can't miss her.
如果你已经准备好了，\n可以去宏礼市挑战钢铁武馆，\n它们的馆主希拉也是前冠军。
Other than that, I know Chara's set up in Sweetrock, near the factory.
至于另一位前冠军夏菈，\n她通常在蜜岩港的工厂附近。
Well, best of luck on that. I'm probably gonna spend the next week contacting anyone that can get my basement fixed.
好的，祝你好运。\n接下来我的花一周时间，\n找人来修一下我家的地下室了。
Ya know, the former champions have got a group chat thing going on.
你听说过吗，\n前冠军们有一个群。
It's not really active, but it makes me feel like part of something, ya know?
虽然不是很活跃，\n但也算是一种象征了，懂吧？
Not now.
稍等
Let's go.
来吧
[Map271]
My brother and I used to be the lightkeepers for the harbor.
我和我哥哥曾经\都是港口的灯塔管理员。
I'm far too old now though, and poor Chara has had to inherit the job.

Her sister is busy with the dojo in Prizca...
而她姐姐...\n则在宏礼市忙着管理武馆...
Between managing the lighthouse and being a top Trainer, it's a miracle she's been able to keep at it for so long.
一边要管理灯塔，\n一边要抽出时间训练宝可梦，\n她能够坚持这么久真是个奇迹。

Haha! I forgot that I was here to do something! Oh well, time to go home!
哈哈，我竟然把正事给忘了，\n现在该回家了！
Nothing like a good battle to set me on my merry way. Now where did I put my Aid Kit...
没有什么能比一场战斗\n更让我感到兴奋的了。\n诶，我急救包呢...
The world is full of adventure, never forget it!
永远不要忘记，\n世界上充满了未知与冒险！
Speaking of forgetting, I'm sure there's something I was supposed to be doing... oh well!
说到忘记...\n诶，我是不是忘了什么事了...

Although she cuts a good figure, she's no figurehead, you understand?

We won. No reason for me to be here. Absolutely none.
我们赢了，\n我也没有理由继续留在这里了，\n这回是真的没什么理由了。
Other than the immense enjoyment I’m about to extract from dismantling your team.
除了我即将从毁灭你\n和你的宝可梦中获得的巨大乐趣。
A friend of Yezera’s. Besides that, I’m masked for a reason.

But you are exceptionally skilled, I understand, and that’s correlated with ego.

You’re good at playing shallow games – good for you.

A Totem calls. I’ve seen more than enough.
图腾在召唤我了，\n我也已经看够了。
They got away. They won. A few that were masked, and whoever the hell THAT was. And Yezera…

Wish I knew. That guy was a narcissist and an asshole, I can tell you that much.

The rest of them… who knows.
其他人…谁知道呢。
Could be anything.

…I don’t know. It doesn’t make any sense.

She should be the last person to pull this kind of stunt.

The caves around Makya are tombs for the Regis. The weird ones I was talking about before. Ones like this.
马凯亚周围的洞穴\n是巨人们的墓穴。\n我说的那些奇怪的东西，\n就像这个一样。
Well, some archaeological teams went to study them a couple decades back.
几十年前，\n一些考古队去研究它们。
And then they found the Regis, and the rich mineral veins, and the ruins, and they figured they could leverage that.
然后他们发现了雷吉一族、\n丰富的矿脉和废墟，\n他们认为可以利用这些资源。
We got some corporate backing from Andris and Mavis, and boom: Team Chasm. I was one of those original archaeologists.
我们得到了安德里斯\n和梅维斯企业的支持，\n于是裂隙队应运而生，\n我便是最初的考古学家之一。
…Some of us. Helena wanted to run her own region. Andris wanted a piece of the organized crime bigtime.
…有些人想要的是...\n海伦娜想要属于自己的王国，\n安德里斯想要成为\n国际犯罪组织的一份子。
Me, I study the Regis. And some people wanted me to leave well enough alone.
我只负责研究巨人，\n但有些人希望我别再插手。
I had a Team and Regidrago on my side, and they didn’t, so I got to study what I damn well pleased.
我有一支团队和雷吉铎拉戈的支持，\n但他们没有，\n所以我可以研究我想研究的东西。
Some of us. I didn’t. I had five Regis – what did I need money for?
我有五个巨人，不需要经费，\n但其他人...
If I wanted lab equipment, I sent a list to Helena.
如果需要实验室设备，\n就会把清单发给海伦娜。
I lived in a research station and ate ramen. Best days of my life.
我当时住在一个研究站里，\n天天吃着泡面...\n那是我一生中最美好的日子。
I just wanted to study the Regis, and with their power, nobody could tell me no. Funny how that works out.
我只想研究巨人，\n而且有了他们的帮助，\n就没有人能限制我了。\n有时我也好奇是怎么到那一步的。
You make it sound so pure and noble.
你让它听起来\如此纯洁和高尚。
I was curious. Wanted answers. I got them – who could tell me no with Regidrago at my side?
我只是很好奇，才去寻求答案，\n我最终得到了想要的答案...\n又有了雷吉铎拉戈在我身边，\n还有谁能阻止我呢？
Not to mention the full might of Team Chasm, 'cause my research was VERY profitable.
再加上我还有强大的裂隙队，\n再加上我的研究非常有价值。
I’m getting to that, but also, hey, it could come in handy some day, yeah?
我正要说这个，但是...\n也许哪天能派上用场，对吧？
As I was saying: we found the five lesser Regis.
正如我所说：\n我们找到了五个巨人的塑像。
It took me years, but I deciphered their inscriptions and understood their true nature.
我花了多年时间\n破译它们的铭文，\n并理解了它们的真正本质。
That led us to Regigigas, and at that point we were cooking with gas.
这带领着我们\n找到了雷吉奇卡斯，\n那时我也在加紧地进行研究。
Gigas was stronger than the rest of the Regis put together, and smarter, too.
雷吉奇卡斯比其他巨人\n加在一起还要强大，\n而且更有智慧。
Shape the earth, revert it back to some kind of primordial clay. Create seals and wards that nothing could get through.
它能够重塑地球，\n将其恢复到某种初始...\n类似于黏土的状态。\n还能创建没有任何人\n能通过的封印和结界。
And, yeah, it could throw a mean Giga Impact.
我想，你也猜到了，\n它也可以发动猛烈的攻击。
It could do… other things, too. We found a way to make it create ethereal Pokémon with its power.
它当然还可以做其他事情，\n比如说我们找到了一种方法，\n可以让它用它的力量\n创造虚幻的宝可梦。
They were hostile, powerful – had to be locked away.
但是它们即强大又凶暴，\n我们只能将它们关起来。
And then by the time Yezera kicked down our door and told us to stop, she was basically just confirming what we already knew.
然后当叶泽拉踹开我们的门\n并让我们停止时，\n她的所作所为基本上证明了\n我们已经意识到的事情。
We were playing with fire. If we kept using Regigigas, we ran the very real chance of destroying the world.
我们在玩火，\n如果我们继续使用雷吉奇卡斯，\n将有无意中毁掉世界的风险。
Or at least permanently changing it. So we put each Regi back in their tomb and went legit.
起码也是造成一些永久性的改变，\n所以我们把每个巨人\n送回它们的墓穴，\n然后依照规则处理好了一切。
The tombs were reinforced, of course – just about nothing can get through the minor Regi chambers.
当然，墓穴被加固了...\n几乎没有谁能穿过那里的防御。
Gigas’s chamber can only be opened by the other five Regis together.
只有其他五个巨人一起，\n才能打开雷吉奇卡斯的密室。
I don’t know. She agreed with us: it was too dangerous. We were criminals, not lunatics.
我不知道。\n她对这件事的看法，\n与我们没什么不同，\n我们的确做过错事，但不是疯子。
I know things… haven’t been great for her, but this? This is insane.
我也知道她的情况…\n并不好，但是这...\n这也太疯狂了。
Who knows. We knew some groups were trying to get them back – they always have been.
谁知道呢，\n我们知道有些组织\n一直在试图找回它们。
But succeeding? There was no way. Impossible. But… apparently Yezera can.
但他们不可能成功。\n只是...叶泽拉似乎是个例外。
…Probably. They might already have.
…可能吧。
Gigas’s chamber is deep down, though, and if they haven’t broken the seal yet, it’d be for nothing.
雷吉奇卡斯的密室在很深的地方，\n如果他们还没有打破封印，\n那就是徒劳。
Or if they’ve resealed it. I can try and scout it out, but… no promises.
或者他们又重新封印了它。\n我可以试着侦察一下，\n但是…不敢说能发现什么。
My POINT is that if you don’t help out, you better get used to the look of white stone.
我的意思是，\n如果你不帮忙，\n你最好习惯全是白色石头的世界。
You’re gonna be seeing a whole lot more of it if someone tells Regigigas to let loose.
如果有人彻底解放了\n雷吉奇卡斯的力量，\n那周围的一切都会变成白色石头。
Listen, I don’t know. I don’t know a lot of things.
我不知道，我也不知道！\n很多事情我都不知道！
So let me talk to Andris, our rangers, Helena, whoever else I can find. We’ll figure out how bad things are.
我觉得应该去跟安德里斯，\n我们的义军，海伦娜，\n还有其他人谈谈。\n这样才能弄清楚情况有多糟。
And if these thieves show their faces aboveground, you can brawl with them.
如果这些小贼露面了，\n那就和他们打一场。
They’ve got at least one Regi, probably more, so there’s a strong temptation to wreak havoc. Trust me – I’d know.
他们起码有一个...甚至更多巨人，\n这让他们无法控制破坏的欲望，\n这一点我是清楚的。
Hate to say it, but you just need to keep being your usual self, kid.
虽然我不想这么说，\n但你只要保持平常就可以了，孩子。
Or, no, I shouldn’t call you kid. Take this – you’ve earned it.
或者，不...我不应该叫你孩子了。\n拿着这个...你一定能用好它。
Used to give these to Chasm strike teams, for cave scouting.
以前给裂隙队用的洞穴探测器。
It’ll get you just about anywhere in the region – nobody hides from you now.
它可以把你带到\n这个地区的任何地方，\n现在别人对你来说都无所遁形了。
So go get those badges and save the day, hero.
所以继续去拿徽章吧，\n然后拯救这个世界，英雄。

她不值得得到完整的善意，\n她本就应该被收回，\n来让她变得更好。

你以为我没有自己的叶泽拉吗？\n我说你会是第二重要的原因...\n我会为最重要的叶泽拉感到自豪。
This one’s beyond repair, though. You deserve better than a girl that’d destroy the world over her social anxiety. She’s quite literally insane.
至于这个已经无法修复了，\n你应该找一个比她更好的女孩，\n而不是一个因为社交焦虑\n而毁灭世界的疯子。
Get rid of her and go back home to your Mavis. She’ll love you even more now that you’ve proven yourself so cleanly.
不要再管她了，\n回家找你的梅维斯吧。\n她会更爱你，因为你...\n已经证明了自己的清白。

她会给你一个人生目标，\n并永远保护你，\n即使到世界末日，\n你也会有一个归宿。

I can’t believe I trusted you!
我为什么会信任过你！
I’m... oh, \PN. I’m, like, I’m not sorry for being, like, wrong.
我...呵，\PN...\n我不为自己之前的作为感到抱歉。
I’m sorry for what I’m about to do to you. Hah! Hahah!
但我会为即将对你做的事情，\n感到由衷的抱歉。\n哈！哈哈哈！
Hahahah! Alright!
哈哈哈！好吧！
Like, fine, Tamarind gets away! But I’ve got someone even better!
大概...塔玛琳已经逃走了，\n但我有了一个更好的人选！
Do I look OK, you idiot?
白痴，我这像是没事的样子？
I’m, like, pretty far down at this point! But I’ve got a shovel and I’m about to dig you down with me!
我...大概...已经失望透顶了！\n但现在我可以将你处理掉！
Yeah. You knew this would happen, you traitor. I hope it’s worth it!
呵，你早就知道会这样，\n你这个叛徒...现在我只有一种选择！
Oh, it is way past time! I can’t believe I let my guard down around you!
哼，已经太晚了！\n我竟然会在你面前放下警惕！
Are you ready? I don’t care.
准备好了？呵，我才不在乎。
Jeanne, you were right. Butcher this creep.
让娜，你说的没错，\n我这就干掉这家伙！
You beat me. Fine! Fine!
好吧，你赢了！
I don’t care! What does it matter? Of course you’re better than me! Everyone is!
但又能怎么样呢？\n你当然比我更强！\n每个人都比我更强！
...You don’t know how, like, completely tempting it is to kick you while you’re down.
你不知道我现在多想狠狠踢你一脚！
You’d deserve it. But I should let you get up. I know I should.
所以，我应该让你站好，\n然后狠狠地...哼！
...So what now? You want to go skitter off and eat treats out of Tamarind’s hand? Fine! See if I care!
那现在怎么办？\n你跑去塔玛琳那里领奖励？\n好啊！我才不会在乎你的选择！
You can burn for all I care. I – I hate you!
你就算被烧死也跟我无关，\n我...我恨你！
I. Don’t. Care! You’re not better than me!
我  才  不  在  乎！
Everyone’s always trying to show they’re better than me because they’ve got the law on their side!
就因为有法律的支持，\n每个人都在试图证明他们比我强！
Or they’re older, or bigger, or a better trainer! Well you’re all idiots! You’re all corrupt! You should all just die!
或者是因为更老，经历更多，\n还是其他的什么原因...\n你们都是一群白痴！\n一群腐败的蛆虫，你们都该去死！
No you’re not! Shut up! Shut up!
闭嘴！闭嘴！闭嘴！
You don’t care what you did! You don’t care that you betrayed me!
你根本不在乎你做了什么！\n你根本不在乎你背叛了我！
Good! I’m glad you hate me! At least that means you have a good reason for hurting me.
很好！我很高兴你恨我！\n这意味着你有伤害我的好理由了。
I hate you too. I hate you so much.
我也恨你，我非常恨你。
Go die! I hate you! Ugh – you make my skin crawl, you manipulative creep!
去死吧！我恨你！\n呃...全身都是鸡皮疙瘩...\n你这个操纵人心的怪物！
I should’ve trusted Jeanne about you.
我就应该听让娜说的...
...It’s over. Everything is over.
…结束了，一切都结束了。
Funny. It’s, like, honestly hilarious.
真是...一个可笑的结局。
I was gonna help Yezera end everything! Reset it all!
我本来要帮叶泽拉结束一切的！\n明明能重置一切！
And now I don’t even want to! Screw that. You don’t deserve justice. None of you do! Why would I want to make everything good?
现在我甚至都不想了！\n随便！你们不配得到正义！\n你们都不配！\n为什么只有我想让一切变好？
Then I don’t get the pleasure of tearing it down! It’s pointless anyways! Nothing I do is ever going to matter!
哪还有摧毁它的乐趣？\n无论我再做什么都没有意义了。
People are all just corrupt lapdogs like you, \PN. Thanks for showing me that.
人类都像你一样，\n是腐败的走狗，\PN，\n谢谢你让我看清了这一点。
I guess you got what you wanted – screw Yezera. I’ll take care of this world myself. My way.
我猜你得到你想要的结局了，\n叶泽拉要怎样现在跟我无关。\n我会用我自己的方式，\n一个人照顾好这个世界。
Toodles, \PN. I’d say I hope I never see you again, but, like, honestly? It’s the opposite.
再见了，\PN。\n我想说我希望永远不再见到你，\n但是...说实话，恰恰相反。
You better PRAY you never see my face again.
你最好祈祷永远不要再见到我。
Congratulations. You’ve, like, totally dethroned Tamarind as my least-favorite person.
恭喜你，你已经完全\n取代塔玛琳在我心中的位置，\n变成我最不喜欢的人了。
Go die in a hole. I hope I never see you again.
去死吧，我希望永远不再见到你。
And, like, yeah, maybe I’m overreacting! Maybe I’m just a crazy bitch!
就算我反应过度了，\n就算我是他们嘴里\n那个疯狂的丫头片子！
But I was hoping for one minute that someone might face real consequences! And you ruined it!
我只是希望有人能为过错买单，\n但你，毁了这一切！
I hate you, \PN. If you follow me, I WILL sic Jeanne on you.
我恨你，\PN。\n如果你敢跟着我，\n我会让让娜好好收拾你一顿。
Toodles, you miserable pig.
再见了，你可怜的猪。
...Your survival instincts tell you not to follow her.
...你的求生本能告诉你不要跟着她。
Candy...
糖儿...
This isn't right.
不能这样
Give her a chance.
给她一个机会
I'm sorry.
抱歉
Candy, calm down.
糖儿，冷静点
No, I'm not.
本来就不是
I have my reasons.
我有自己的理由
Are you... OK?
你...还好吧？
Fine.
好吧
About time.
差不多了
I hate you too.
我也恨你
I love you.
我喜欢你

Hauling crates all day is hard work.
每天都要装货卸货好辛苦...
The Timburr and Gurdurr are good help, but I'd really like to have another helper around here.
的确，搬运小匠和铁骨土人\n帮我们分摊了大部分的工作，\n但我们依然需要新的帮手。
Any Fighting-type should be able to handle the workload.
只要是格斗系的宝可梦就行。
I've got a Galarian Ponyta to offer, got it as a gift from my girlfriend overseas.
我这里有一只伽勒尔的小火马，\n可以作为交换条件。
I'm sure she'll understand. Wanna trade?
这是我海外的女友给我的礼物...\n我想她会理解我的难处的\n（在箱子里选择宝可梦）...
Well in that case, happen to have a back brace on you by any chance?
你是身上没有带，\n还是有其他什么原因？
Hmm, maybe I just need to take more breaks.
嗯，或许我只需要多休息一会儿。
That Pokemon seems just right for the job.
这只宝可梦看起来很适合这份工作。
I'll put this guy right to work, yeah?
我会立刻训练它加入到工作中。
My back and legs thank you, Trainer. The Pokemon you traded me is loving all the exercise too.
我的腰背肌肉都非常感激你，\n那只宝可梦也很喜欢这里的生活。
No
不换
Yes
换

The fridge contains dozens of tupper-ware containers, all marked with dates as well as specific Pokemon species names.
冰箱里有十几个保鲜盒，\n上面都标有日期和宝可梦的种类名。

A collection of Pokemon battling guides.
宝可梦对战指南合集。
They seem like classics, likely more than 50 years old.
相当经典得书，\n看起来得有50年的历史了。
A beat up old television.
一台破旧的电视机。
It's been unplugged from the wall.
插头已经拔下来了。

Looks like the Trainer ahead is moving to block you from going any further.
前方的训练家\n显然不会允许你通过。
Do you want to approach them? It looks like a tough fight.
要贸然靠近他们吗？\n这将是一场恶战。
I knew you would seek Yezera. I am her humble servant, naturally, though I would rather keep my identity enshrouded.
我知道你会寻找叶泽拉，\n我是她的谦卑仆人...\n当然，我更希望没人知道我是谁。
Pray excuse the charade – it will not be necessary for much longer.
至于这份伪装，请别在意...\n很快就不再需要它了。
Under Yezera’s profound guidance, we have achieved our goals. The titans have served their purpose.
在叶泽拉的指导下，\n我们已经完成了目标，\n巨人们已经完成了使命。
I come then with a simple inquiry: will you not listen to my reasoning?
现在有一个简单的问题：\n你就不想听一下理由吗？
Thank you. Our goal is naught less than a complete reordering of the world.
谢谢，我们的目标，\n不仅仅是为了重构这个世界。
My comrades have their own motives, but mine is simple.
每个人都有自己的动机，\n而我的愿望很简单。
The world at present is mercurial and deceptive. Human culture and technology serves as naught but a veil disguising ultimate truth.
目前的世界充满了欺骗与变化，\n人类的技术与文化，\n都在掩盖本应被大家知晓的真相。
Only the realm of ancient myth, tended by gods, untouched by humans, might let us perceive it. Do you not agree?
只有古老神话的领域，\n在神灵守护中，未曾被人类触及，\n才得以让我们触碰到真实。\n你不同意吗？
How disappointing, to dismiss it outright. If you have no eye for truth, then we have nothing else to speak of.
你竟然直接否定了这一切。\n既然你没有看清一切的眼光，\n那也就没什么可说的了。
Forgive me this act of passion, but I expect a titan’s wrath may settle my raging heart.
请原谅我的情绪波动，\n但巨人的愤怒将会抚平这一切。
Regice, heed my command.
雷吉艾斯，听我号令。
To the contrary: it has adamant support, if only one ruminates on the matter.
只要人们肯深入思考，\n就会发现这一切是对的。
Such wavering faith is nigh-useless for my purposes, alas. We require unflinching devotion.
但这种满是动摇的信仰\n对我的目的没有任何作用，\n我们需要更加坚定的信念。
*sigh* I would be forsaking my duty if I did not stall you at the least. Prepare yourself.
*轻笑声*为了履行我的职责，\n起码要拖延你前进的进程。\n做好准备吧！
I should encourage you to do so. Judge the weight of the world that is against the world that could be.
我很高兴你愿意这样做，\n去评估世界的重量，\n对比真实与虚伪。
Alas, I know you will not ruminate idly upon it. You are a threat. That is intolerable to us.
但我不会就这样等着，\n现在的你仍是威胁，\n我们无法容忍的威胁。
This shall be no decisive victory of mine, but I cannot let you pass unhindered.
我知道想要赢你并不容易，\n但也不能让你轻松通过这里。
…I should very much like to believe you.
...我也很希望能相信你。
If you speak truth, then I bid you repeat your convictions to Yezera herself next you meet.
如果你真是这样想的，\n那下次见到叶泽拉时，\n请重复你刚才的想法。
She can see the machinations of your heart more clearly than I. Until then, you remain a trainer, as do I.
她比我更擅长\n看清别人内心的阴谋，\n但现在我们仍然是对手。
My enemy I smite, my ally I train. To either, en garde.
而对手，就是要击败的。
If you will not listen to my entreaties, then you are beyond salvation.
连最基本的倾听都不愿意，\n也就代表你已经无药可救了。
Alas. Perhaps a titan’s fury will enlighten you to the clarity of the ancients.
唉，或许巨人的怒火，\n能让你清晰地认识到这一切。
G’afternoon. Took your sweet time comin’ to find Yezera 'gain, didn’t ya?
下午好，为了来找叶泽拉，\n你也花费了不少时间对吧？
Got no interest in convincing you. Ain’t much of a preacher.
我没有说服你的兴趣，\n我也不擅长这种工作。
But I gotta set some ground rules 'fore we fight; establish some things. 'Cause we’re gonna fight. Ain’t no other way to it.
但在我们战斗之前，\n我还是得先说明一些事情。
Thank you kindly. I ain’t real interested in this cloak- and-dagger charade.
非常感谢，首先我对这种\n披着面纱的阴谋毫不感兴趣。
I’m with Yezera, always.
我只是一直在帮叶泽拉做事。
Listen, I’m only gonna say this once: you oughta hear her out.
注意，我只说一次：\n你应该去听听她的意见。
Don’t care if you agree with her. Just hear her out.
无论你是否认可她的想法，\n只是去听听，应该不难吧。
And if you hurt her, I’ll make you wish Mavis stopped after Zain. We clear?
但是如果你伤害到她，\n我会让你输给赞恩的，明白了吗？
Cocky li’l brat, ain’t ya? Tsk.
真是个自大的家伙。
What’s so damn infuriating 'bout you is I ain’t just able to whip your sorry hide into submission. Too good.
然而让我不爽的是，\n我没办法轻松击败你，\n你的确有些实力。
How 'bout I try anyhow? Titan’s gotta be good for somethin’, right?
所以就来试试吧，\n看看巨人拥有怎样的力量。
Good. I ain’t 'bout ta repeat myself.
好的，我不想重复自己的话。
Now, I came here with a job to do, and I’m a reliable sort.
现在，作为一个可靠的同伴，\n我还是得完成自己的任务。
Sorry, kid. Yezera wants some peace 'n' quiet. Regice, lead us off, will ya darlin’?
抱歉了，小家伙。\n叶泽拉现在不能被打扰，\n我得让你放慢一些脚步。\n上吧，雷吉艾斯！
Hah. Take it from someone who knows, kid: you ain’t even scratched the surface.
哈，我只能以我的经验告诉你，\n你甚至连表面都还未触及到。
I can make you plenty more miserable if I set my mind to it.
只要我想，我还能继续拖你的时间。
But, cheer up, kid. I’m 'bout to give ya what you always want: a good fight. Facing a Regi oughta cheer ya up. Heh.
不过，你应该想要\n一场优质的对局吧？\n面对雷吉艾斯，\n或许能让你振奋起来。
Nah, I ain’t about to trust that. Ya don’t know jack about me and Yezera.
哼，我才不信这句话！\n你根本不了解我和叶泽拉的事。
Bickering old married couple, that’s what we are.
我们已经是经常拌嘴的老夫妻了。
Want to show me you’re with us? Tell it to Yezera.
如果要证明你的想法，\n那就把这些想法告诉她吧！
For now, I ain’t too keen on letting you off easy. Sorry. Beating folks into the dirt is my job, after all.
但现在，我不会让你轻易脱身的，\n将你打得落花流水就是我的工作。
Ah, well. Guess no matter how hard I try, old habits die hard.
呵，好吧，不管怎么努力，\n老习惯还是不肯消停啊。
Speaking of dying hard – lay down and quit moving, will ya?
说到这里...\n现在得请你消停一下了。
Hah. They ain’t never been happy with my way of goin’ about covert ops.
哈哈，他们也觉得\n我不擅长秘密行动。
Too rough 'nd tumble. I ain’t built for cloak-and-dagger.
我行事太过直白粗暴。
So, let me tell you straight: you listen to Yezera. You hear her out. And don’t you dare hurt her.
所以，我就直白地告诉你了：\n去听取叶泽拉的意见，\n倾听她的想法，不许伤害她。
All I ask. And, uh, I wasn’t just sent here to chit-chat. You ready?
这就是我唯一的要求。\n当然我也不是来找你闲聊的，\n现在你准备好了吗？
Oh, hello.
哦，你好。
Such a picturesque place to meet. If only it were under better circumstances.
在这么一个美丽的地方相遇，\n如果情况能更好些就完美了。
Regice and I have unfortunately been told to make sure Yezera has no unwelcome visitors.
然而，我被要求来这里，\n确保叶泽拉不欢迎的\n访客无法继续前进，\n所以我跟雷吉艾斯便在这里等着了。
Before that, though… I know you’re more than a pretty face. You’ve got a spark to you. Will you listen to me?
我知道你不仅有好看的面容，\n还有着聪慧的大脑，\n所以在交手前能听我说完吗？
Aww. I knew I had a good feeling about you.
啊，我就知道你是个好人。
How do I explain it… well, I hate to use the word, but modern society is degenerate.
我该怎么解释呢…\n嗯...我不想用这个词，\n但现代社会的的确确是堕落的。
We’re distant from the perfect moment of creation. We’ve kind of taken over the world.
我们远离了神创造的完美世界，\n对一切掌握得过多了。
No respect for our elders – the primordial Pokémon that created the universe.
我们并没有给予\n创造宇宙的宝可梦足够的尊重。
Yezera’s going to reset this world back to its origins. And then humanity will be in the bosom of Arceus once more.
叶泽拉将会把一切回溯到起源，\n届时人类将再次\n回到阿尔宙斯的怀抱。
Don’t call me insane. Although I’m sure this arrogant, faithless civilization would use that term.
不许用这个词来称呼我，\n这是傲慢又没有信仰的文明\n才会用的堕落词汇！
I’m merely devout, and devotion means making sacrifices. For example: you.
我只是虔诚而已，\n虔诚即意味着做出牺牲。\n就好比：你。
I really do like you, but… we all have to sacrifice sometimes.
我真的很喜欢你，但是...\n牺牲是绝对不可避免的。
Godlike Pokémon are now treated as not much more than beasts of burden.
那些神明一般的宝可梦\n现在都被看作是牲畜一般。
Avatars are destroyed at will because they’re “threats to humans.”
化身被肆意地摧毁，\n就因为它们是“对人类的威胁”。
The world has lost all respect, the divine essence from creation diluted and destroyed.
这个世界已经毫无尊重可言，\n神圣的本质被稀释、破坏。
And since you seem to be no different, I can take some joy in this fight.
既然你也没什么不同，\n那就在这场战斗中获得一些乐趣吧。
Arceus created the world. It is pure, and perfect, and resetting the world back to its original form will let us be pure and perfect too.
阿尔宙斯创造了这个世界，\n它是最纯净、最完美的，\n而重置后的我们也会变得纯净和完美。
I’d like to see myself blessed by the grace of our creator.
我想要得到神的恩典与祝福。
I’d like to see you that way, too.
我希望你也能得到这些。
In time.
时间差不多了。
For now, I’ve been ordered to remove you. Shall we dance?
我接到的命令是拖延你的时间，\n那么现在，我们起舞吧？
Good. I knew I saw something in you.
很好，我知道你身上迸发出了什么。
Some spark of faith. I’m a… very good judge of character.
那是一些信仰的火花，\n而我是一个...善于识人的人。
I’d love to just talk with you for a while, but I was explicitly instructed to stop you. So we’ll fight. Don’t take it personally.
我很想和你多聊一会儿，\n但我的任务是要阻止你，\n所以我们还是要对决，\n这跟我个人的情感无关。
Oh. Was I too forward?
哦，我太直接了吗？
My emotions tend to get the better of me. I’m almost heartbroken.
我总是会被自己的情绪控制，\n我现在心都要碎了。
Well, I suppose I am a stranger.
也对，我现在是个陌生人。
Fortunately, I’ve been sent to ensure you make it no farther, so I have a convenient vent for all these feelings of rejection.
好在我的任务就是来拖延你，\n眼前正好有一个方便的出气口，\n释放掉这些被拒绝的痛苦。
Hello, friend. Yezera wishes to be alone.
你好，朋友，\n叶泽拉想要独处一会儿。
To that end, I have been sent, and graciously afforded a titan to aid me.
所以我被派到这里来了，\n还带着一个巨人。
Before we attend to your removal, however, may I interest you in a short, frank discussion?
不过在我把你赶走之前，\n可以先做一个简短的讨论吗？
I would rather like to try to convince you of the legitimacy of our position.
我想试着说明我们的立场是正确的。
Thank you for your time.
感谢你的时间。
Yezera’s goal is to recreate the conditions of the world shortly following its creation.
叶泽拉的目标是\n重现世界诞生后不久的样子。
Modern science has attained almost complete understanding and mastery over the world – the modern world.
现代科学已经几乎\n完全理解和掌握了现在的这个世界。
It cannot, however, understand the past. By reverting existence, we may study the universe from its conception and obtain universal knowledge.
但是，却无法理解过去。\n通过回到过去，\n我们就可以研究宇宙开始的概念，\n并获得宝贵的知识。
This is the only way to do so.
这是唯一的方法。
Without the reversion, humanity will never attain complete understanding of the universe. It is worth all prices.
如果不这么做，\n人类将永远无法理解宇宙，\n这些代价是值得的。
Now our time for conversation is up, however. Regice, please do the honors.
现在，交流时间结束，\n雷吉艾斯，开始行动。
All persons who attempt to advance civilization should care.
所有试图让文明\n得以推进的人都应该关心。
Universal knowledge is a prerequisite for an all- powerful society.
知识普及是使文明\n进入新时代的先决条件。
That is my goal. That is the goal of all science: to know, and to apply that knowledge.
这是我的目标，\n也是所有科学发展的目标：\n理解，并运用那些知识。
Your ignorance implies discussion will get us nowhere. Let us dispense with such, then.
你的无知也就代表着，\n我们的讨论不会有任何进展，\n那么就没有继续下去的必要了。
Knowledge will be retained into the new primordial era.
知识将被保留到新的原始时代。
We can rebuild at least small enclaves of humanity.
我们可以重建人类的小聚落。
From there our analysis and conquest will begin: a new society with absolute knowledge.
并以此为基准开始分析与征服，\n并发展为一个\n拥有绝对知识的新社会。
And, stemming from this absolute knowledge, absolute power.
同时，还会因为绝对的知识，\n拥有绝对的力量。
Consider it. In the mean time, there is the business I mentioned earlier. Excuse me.
考虑一下吧，与此同时，\n我也该执行接到的任务了。
I am glad you have the wisdom to agree. If you should wish to support us in our endeavors, I will be happy to have you.
我很高兴你拥有这份智慧，\n如果你愿意支持我们的事业，\n我很高兴能有你的加入。
We will fight for a more enlightened era. For now, however, I must slow you. Business is business. Let us commence.
我们将为一个更开明的时代而战，\n但现在，我必须阻止你。\n任务如此，让我们开始吧。
I find this highly unfortunate. You will be left behind by progress.
这并不是一个正确的选择，\n你将被进步抛在脑后。
If you would prefer to retain your ignorance, however, I cannot help you.
然而，既然你自愿保持无知，\n那我也无能为力。
Prepare yourself. Regice, if you would.
准备好了吗？\n雷吉艾斯，出击。
Yo. Figure’d, uh, yeah, that you’d be here.
嘿，我就猜你会在这里。
Yezera’s here. You keep running into her. She, uh, doesn’t really want to talk right now.
没错，叶泽拉也在这里，\n但你总是打扰到她...\n她...呃...现在不想说话。
I got a job to do, but, uh, not keen on it.
现在这个任务...呃...我不太喜欢。
So you want to hear us out?
我该怎么说呢…\n你有兴趣听听我们的想法吗？
Swear we’ve got some good reasons. Even if I’m not that good at putting it in words.
但是...你应该明白，\n我们不想与你敌对，你觉得呢？
Oh. That’s good. Great. Honestly didn’t expect that.
哦，那太好了！\n真的没想到...
Well, I just figure we’ve done a lot of ordering Pokémon around.
我只是觉得我们不应该\n将那么多命令强加给宝可梦。
Maybe it’s time to even up the footing a bit, y’know?
也许是时候让我们\n站在同样的地位上了，大概...
We can all kinda make up for whatever we did wrong.
我们有机会弥补以前所犯的错误。
The others have their reasons, but, uh, this is mine. Make a world where we can be forgiven. You get it?
其他人有他们自己的理由，\n但...呃...这是我的理由。\n创造一个我们可以被原谅的世界，\n你能理解我的意思吗？
Well – fine. You know what? Fine.
好吧...你有自己的想法。
I don’t need your permission, and we certainly don’t need your help. Regice. Do ‘em in.
当然，我不需要你的认可，\n也不需要你的帮助，\n雷吉艾斯，干掉他。
…You so sure? Takes a lot of pushing to train a team that strong in so little time.
...你确定？\n这么短的时间内\n训练出这么多强大的宝可梦，\n这得需要多大的压力啊！
But, yeah, no, I get it. Why would you help us?
但是，啊...我明白了，\n你并没有帮助我们的理由。
Rich brat. Maybe we can beat some responsibility into you.
毕竟你是个富家子弟，\n你应该承担起更多责任。
Uh. Don’t really know how to break it to you. You… don’t have time.
嗯，我不知道该怎么说...\n你...没有思考的时间了。
For one, we’ve already just about won. For two – think fast!
首先，我们已经快成功了，\n其次...我还有自己的任务。
Regice, sweep ‘em off their feet!
雷吉艾斯，把他解决掉吧！
Oh. Didn’t, uh, really expect that.
哦，没想到会这样。
Figured you were kind of a stuck-up brat. No offense.
我本以为你就是个\n自大的富家子弟...\n抱歉，请不要介意。
Well, good. Maybe we’ll be side by side one day, yeah?
好吧，也许有一天，\n我们会并肩作战，对吧？
But, uh, for now… I’m supposed to fight you.
但是，现在...\n我应该和你战斗。
So, uh, sorry – ah, what am I saying, we live for this. Ready up.
所以，抱歉...\n啊，我在说什么，都到这一步了...\n准备好了吗？
Yeah, I guess that tracks.
哈，我觉得也会是这样。
Fine. That’s… it’s fine.
好吧，没关系。
I came here to beat the crap out of you anyways.
我来这里就是为了揍你一顿的。
Odds are Regice isn’t gonna stick around much longer, so let’s make it count. Try your best, eh?
雷吉艾斯很快就要离开了，\n所以我要尽可能地利用好它。
Well. Had to happen eventually, I guess.
嗯...我知道迟早有这一天。
I’ve kinda sorta been planning what to say for the past few hours.
这几个小时我一直\n在计划要说些什么。
But, um… I still don’t know. So can I just say what comes to mind and hope you understand?
但是，嗯...我还是不知道，\n所以我只能说出心里想的话，\n你愿意听听吗？
Welp. Listen, uh, Makya’s kinda in a weird place right now.
嗯...差不多...呃...\n马凯亚现在的情况很糟糕。
Team Chasm ran roughshod over this whole region and then kinda just… got away with it?
之前裂隙队在这里到处肆虐，\n然后就这样...撂挑子走了？
So, uh, yeah, if you ever wanted proof that humans can’t get even the most black-and-white justice right, there you are.
所以，这就是人类\n甚至连正确分辨是非善恶\n都做不到的最直接的证据。
Would’ve been simple to fix that little screw-up. But they didn’t.
本来很容易就能处理这些问题的，\n但他们没有这样做。
So we’re taking the power away from humans, and putting it in the hands of Pokémon.
所以我们要把权力\n从人类手中夺走，\n交到宝可梦手中。
Is it? Is it!
啊？这就是答案吗？
Am I insane for wanting some damn PUNISHMENT in this world?!
我就是希望他们\n得到应有的正义审判，\n是我的问题吗？
Well, guess what. If people won’t give me it, I’ll MAKE it.
行，无所谓了，\n既然大家不愿这么做，\n那我就自己去审判。
And I’ve got just the tool!
而我有很好的帮手！
It is simple, you – you idiot!
这明明很简单，你...你个白痴！
I can track down every ex-Chasm criminal and haul them up to the courts myself if I have to!
只要想这么办，\n我可以把每个裂隙队成员，\n亲自拖到法庭上受审。
They just won’t do anything if I did! So I have to do things personally, yeah?
但他们什么都没有做！\n所以我必须亲自去做这一切！
Sorry. Nothing… personal.
抱歉，这不是个人恩怨。
Yes!
没错！
They’re noble and pure and – and – and they’d never let me down!
他们高贵而纯洁...\n他们永远不会让我失望！
Unlike you! And everyone else around here!
不像你！\n还有你周围的每个人！
You want to see? C’mon. See what kind of justice Pokémon can give!
要见识一下吗？\n看看宝可梦能给出什么样的正义吧！
Oh. Ah-hah.
哦，啊哈。
Kinda got myself a bit worked up there… welp, no harm, no foul, yeah?
咳咳...有点激动…\n不过无伤大雅。
…Nah, that’s stupid.
…不，还是丢脸...
I’m not gonna waste this chance. I’ve got a Regi. You’re a prodigy. Let’s RUMBLE!
无论如何，我不会浪费这个机会，\n毕竟手里有一个巨人，\n我们来战吧！
Urgh, you make me so mad!
你让我很生气！
Nobody will frickin’ listen to me!
没人听我说话！
Fine.
好吧。
Y’know, fine, whatever.
好吧，随你便。
You get what everyone else I fight gets. What you deserve.
你会在我这里品尝到应有的失败！
Regice – your service has ended. If you would go, then go.
雷吉艾斯，你的任务结束了，\n你可以凭自己的意愿离开了。
So it returns to its resting place… no matter. It has done all I desired and more.
它现在回自己的安息之低了...\n但它已经超额完成了我的目的。
As for you, we shall meet again.
至于你，我们会再见面的。
When and where, fate shall decide, though I think I know where we shall settle this.
命运将会决定我们何时再相见。
Do not pursue me. Your audience with Yezera awaits.
不要跟过来了，叶泽拉还在等你。
Seems Regice’s 'bout spent.
看起来雷吉艾斯已经快不行了。
Didn’t exactly expect them to be so squirrelly, but them’s the breaks.
没想到你竟然这么难缠，\n但也不觉得意外就是了。
Figure it’s headin’ back to its home.
它应该已经在回家的路上了。
One last thing, since you seem ‘bout ready to see Yez again: you hurt her and I’ll find you.
最后，既然你打算去见叶泽拉，\n如果你敢伤害到她，\n我会立即来收拾你。
And it won’t just be for some play fight with animals.
到时候就不是宝可梦之间的对决了。
G’evening, kid. I’ll be seein’ you. Keep in mind how nice it feels to be havin’ all your bones intact.
晚安，小家伙，\n我们还会再见的，\n当我们再见时，希望不是\n你让我怒不可遏的时候，好吗？
Au revoir, Regice. Enjoy your entombment, I suppose.
再见了，雷吉艾斯，\n享受你的安宁吧。
And as for you, I’m breathless. Speechless. You’re even better than I imagined.
这真是一场激动人心的战斗，\n你比我想象中要强得多。
If you’d like to stop your pointless struggling against us, tell Yezera.
如果你想停止无意义的纷争，\n就来找叶泽拉吧。
We’d love to have you. Until we meet again…
我们很希望你的协助，\n直到我们再次相遇...
I surmise Regice will now return to its tomb.
我想雷吉艾斯应该\n回它的墓穴里面去了。
The titans are temperamental and ill-suited to existence outside their crypts.
巨人们的情况很特别，\n不能长时间待在墓穴外。
It is of no matter. Our victory comes soon.
不过这无关紧要，\n我们的胜利即将到来。
Yezera may be displeased in my performance, but she is understanding.
叶泽拉可能会对我的表现不满，\n但她肯定能理解。
In the end, this will make no difference. Thank you for your time.
最后，我不会再阻拦你，\n谢谢你的时间。
See ya, Regice.
再见了，雷吉艾斯。
Ah, who am I kidding.
啊，我在开玩笑。
If either of us is gonna see it again, it’ll be you. Couldn’t really hold a candle to you.
果然我无法与你相提并论，\n我相信你或许还能再见到它。
Had to try anyways, just for Yezera. And I’m gonna have to do it again, right?
但我无论如何都要尝试一下，\n只是为了叶泽拉。
Good practice, I guess. Well, think about it – everything, y’know? I’m out.
我觉得这是场不错的训练，\n现在我该走了，\n去思考一下这一切。
*sigh* So long, Regice. You never really were my type, anyways, so head on home.
*叹气*再见了，瑞吉艾斯，\n你从来都不是我想要的类型，\n所以你可以回去了。
And as for YOU, well, next time we talk it’ll be in a fair world!
至于你，下次，\n我们会在一个公平的世界里交谈！
If it isn’t, then, uh, I’ll have to buy us a li’l more time, 'kay?
如果不是的话...那么...大概...\n那就再多给我点时间好吗？
Until then, I’ve got judgment to be a-judging. So long, "hero."
估计我还要再努力一下了，\n再见，“英雄”。

Regigigas considers for a moment, perfectly still. Then it assents, moving with heavy steps to aid you.

这就是雷吉奇卡斯被埋葬的地方，\n我终结了裂隙队，在无聊中徘徊，\n开始与雷吉奇卡斯交谈。

这是整件事中最有趣的部分，\n也是结束一切的必要一环。
…I know Mavis is going to be watching our duel. Makes me a little sick.

Don’t want it to be tainted by knowing I’m supposed to be "proving myself."

Nothing for it, though. One last battle? I’m not going to lose this one like all the others.

Can’t change my mind, kid.
我不会改主意的，小鬼。
Screw Mavis. Screw the company. Screw the gyms, screw the Championship, screw Makya.
特么的梅维斯，特么的公司，\n特么的道馆，特么的竞技大会，\n特么的马凯亚！
Gonna go find out what I’m actually interested in, 'stead of just trying to one-up you for mommy. But thanks for the concern.
我要去找自己真正感兴趣的东西了，\n而不是为了让妈妈高兴，\n而试图超越你，\n总之还是谢谢你的关心。
Don’t. Seriously.
别这样。
I know she’s our mom, but she’s the reason we’ve been at each other’s throats. Or, uh, I’ve been at yours.
我知道她是我们的妈妈，\n但她就是我们一直相互敌视的原因，\n起码是我敌视你的原因。
I’m getting away from her. She wants to talk, she can start by not pitting us against each other.
所以我会离开她，\n等她什么时候意识到错误了，\n我也不会不给她机会。
…It is what it is, you know?
大概...就这样吧。
You need me, you call, alright? I’ll pick up for you.
如果你需要我帮忙了，\n就直接给我打电话吧，\n你的电话我还是会接的。
Congratulations, Champion. Love ya. Go be a hero and kick some ass.
总之，恭喜你冠军，\n爱来自你的哥哥，\n去当你的英雄吧，\n然后去踢某些人的屁股。
I had assumed we'd meet later in the Tournament, to be honest.
我本以为我们会在比赛后相遇。
Oh well, no use worrying about the seeding now. Just need to focus on the battle.
也好，这样就不用再考虑那么多，\n只要专注于战斗就可以了。
I'm going all in. Be ready.
我会全力以赴的，\n准备好了吗？
Hmm, a disappointing result. Seems like I won't be the first repeat champion.
嗯，还是有点失望，\n看来我不能成为第一位双冠王了。
Best of luck, it'll feel better to lose to the person who takes it all.
继续加油哦，\n如果是输给了最后的胜者\n好像也不差。
How d'ya do? Surprised to see me?
嘿嘿，看到我很惊讶？
Well, I ain’t 'bout to let this opportunity pass me up.
我是不想放过这个机会啦。
Don’t much matter to me if the world’s endin'. C’mon. Let’s have us a grand ol’ fight.
对我来说，末不末日的无所谓，\n起码现在要来一场盛大的战斗！
How d'ya do? \PN?

Ya ready?

Ain’t too surprised ‘bout that one. I tried my best, honest, but I ain’t your rival. Heh.
并不意外的结果，\n我尽力了，但仍不是你的对手。
Oughta leave you to Yez. Ah, well, I figure I might get a second shot at you.
我觉得你应该去跟叶泽拉来一场...\n到时候或许还会有下一次交手。
We’ll see, huh? I’ll be watchin’, kid.
会有那一天的，对吧小家伙。
So y'are good, aren'tcha?
所以你的确还不错。
Yezera ain’t much of a liar, but I figured maybe she got a li'l rusty.
叶泽拉从来都不会撒谎，\n不过或许有些生疏了。
Quite a team, kid. And quite a trainer they got. I’ll be watchin', kid. I’ll be watchin'.
出色的训练家还有优秀的团队，\n我会亲眼见证你接下来的表现，\n继续加油吧，小家伙。
Good day.

I’ve competed in every Championship since their inception. I wasn’t about to miss this one, avatars or no.

I want to face you. And now I can.
而且我也想和你再次交手。
It brings a smile to my face… though now that must be snuffed out, and my mind set… on the fight to come…
这让我有种很兴奋得感觉...\n不过现在得把这种情绪收起来，\n将思维集中在即将到来的对战上了...
…Hmm. I lost. I don’t know why I expected to win so shortly after our last match.
…嗯，我输了。\n毕竟距离我们上次交手也没多久，\n想就此战胜你未免有点异想天开了。
Ah well! It was fun while it lasted, and it was good to see you again.
好吧，虽然时间不长，\n但玩得很高兴。
In a way, I’m glad I lost so decisively. If I’d become Champion, the hassle of dealing with the gym would be a nightmare!
不过，从另一个角度来说，\n输掉对我来说也是好事，\n如果成为冠军还要\n同时处理道馆绝对是一场噩梦！
Goodbye, \PN. Come talk to me again sometime, though. My door is always open.
再见，\PN。\n有时间再来找我聊天，\n我家的门永远为你敞开着。
Oh, hey. I didn’t think I’d get this far. I didn’t think – well, didn’t think a lot of things.
我从没想过能走到今天这一步，\n我还没...还有很多事没准备好。
Doesn’t matter now. Win or lose, I’m ready to face you.
现在无所谓了，\n无论输赢，我都要面对你了。
And, uh, I’m looking forward to seeing you give 100%. Let’s go.
我希望你也能全力以赴，\n现在开始吧。
Yo. I’m Eifion. You’re, uh, \PN, yeah?
你好，我是艾维恩。\n你是，嗯...\PN，对吧？
The kid who’s been running errands for Tamarind? Heard you’re, uh, pretty scary.
就是你在帮塔玛琳跑腿？\n我听说你很可怕。
About half the trainers I talk to have lost to you at some point or another.
我聊过天的训练家当中，\n一半以上都输给过你。
... I, uh, don’t plan on being one of them.
...嗯，我不打算成为其中之一。
Damn!
该死！
I – I gave my best. My team did too. All I can ask for.
我...我尽力了...\n这已经是我的全力了。
You too, you know? You’re doing great. Really impressive. I’ll, uh, I’ll try again next year.
你做得真的很出色，\n回头我会再挑战你一次的。
If there is one next year. Gonna be rooting for you anyhow.
如果有这个机会的话...\n但现在，我会为你加油。
Huh. Well, I see why you’ve got so many notches on your Poké Balls.
我想这就是你的宝可梦球上，\n有那么多划痕的原因了。
Somebody’s gonna humble you one day. Looking forward to seeing that – but I’m gonna root for you until then.
总有一天会有人让你学会谦逊，\n但现在我会为你加油。
I like an underdog story, but I also like betting on the winning horse. G’luck, \PN.
我喜欢看到弱者爆冷，\n但也同时喜欢在高手身上下注，\n总之，祝你好运，\PN。
Figured I’d be seein’ you again. It’s been a little while, hasn’t it?
我就知道会有这么一天，\n距离上一次交手已经有段时间了。
Seems like just yesterday you were showing up and showing down with me on Casaba.
虽然感觉起来仿佛还是昨天，\n好像你离开甜瓜岛也没多久。
I’m not about to go down so easy a second time.
总之，我不会轻易倒下的。
You ready? I am.
你准备好了吗？\n我可早就准备好了。
Heh. Guess I never should’ve figured I could beat you.
哈哈，其实我从没想过能赢。
I’ll be rooting for you, kid.
我会为你加油的，孩子。
Shouldn’t call you kid, I guess. Barely recognize you, honestly.
也许不应该叫你孩子，\n毕竟，你已经成长到\n我快要认不出的地步了。
Good luck. Even though I doubt you’ll need it.
祝你在接下来的比赛中好运。
Oh, well, look what the Shinx dragged in. \PN.
哦，看看谁来了，\PN。
Eight years ago, I lost to Yezera, and because of that Team Chasm fell.
八年前，我输给了叶泽拉，\n并因此导致了裂隙队的覆灭。
I’ve been training since then. I’m planning on redeeming myself among the scattered remnants of your team.
从那时起，我便一直努力训练，\n并试图在与你的对战中，\n找回自己的失去的一切。
Nothing personal – I actually rather appreciate you. You’re just the most convenient point of comparison.
我没有人身攻击的意思...\n实际上我很欣赏你，\n只是将你作为目标比较方便罢了。
Now, let’s see if I can’t snuff out this child’s hopes and dreams.
现在，让我们看看\n我能不能就此扼杀\n这个孩子的希望和梦想。
*sigh* I’ll need to see my dentist. I think I lost an inch of enamel to grinding my teeth that hard.
唉，我得找时间去看看牙医了，\n刚才的局面让我\n磨掉了一毫米的牙釉质。
What is it about you that makes you so infuriatingly adaptable?
你到底是怎么做到这种程度的？
Fine. Fine! I’ll resign myself to the only thing I’m good at.
算了，习惯了，\n反正我还有其他擅长的事。
I’ll turn this region into an economic powerhouse, become even richer than Mavis, and buy LuxTech out from under her.
我会让马凯亚的经济腾飞，\n我终究会比梅维斯更富有，\n买下她手中所有的光华股份。
Enjoy my petty revenge. And good luck with the Championship or whatever. I’m done here.
就当是我小小的复仇吧，\n希望你接下来的比赛也能好好发挥，\n现在，我该就此退场了。
Hello! Hale and hearty, I hope?
嘿，最近怎么样？
Oh, rest easy, I have no interest in the title. No, I am here because a champion is in the making, and they must be tested!
哦，你放心，\n我对冠军头衔没什么兴趣。\n只是作为必要的一关，\n来这里见证冠军崛起而已。
Tested with fire! Tested with toxin! Tested with the unyielding agony that only the truest champion can withstand!
准备好应对火与毒的考验了吗？\n通过这场只有真正的冠军，\n才能承受下来的痛苦考验！
Now embrace it, and show me your worth!
那就去拥抱痛苦吧，\n展现你的实力与价值！
Blazing, brilliant, bearing both mercy and ruthlessness in equal measure!
炽热、辉煌，\n同时还包含着仁慈和无情的特质
Ah ha ha! I’ll bow out now – now the role of the testing solvent belongs to you alone.
啊哈哈！我该退场了，\n后面还有其他的考验等着你。
Enjoy it! Revel in it! I’ll be cheering for you.
好好享受吧！\n尽情沉浸其中吧！\n我会为你加油的。
Oh, it’s you! I’ve been waiting for this fight.
哦，是你啊！\n我一直在等待这场战斗。
You would not BELIEVE the time I put into training after you got our badge!
你想象不到我在你拿到徽章后，\n花了多少时间在训练上！
If you’re thinking I’m just another rando, think again. Zoé and I got trained by Yezera herself back when it was her gym!
不要觉得我只是个普通人，\n我和佐伊都曾在\n叶泽拉的道馆接受她的训练。
Then I doubled down and went extra hard on training after you showed up. You are NOT prepared!
至于上次的失利，\n只是因为我还没准备好！
You WERE prepared! Wow!
还是你准备得更充分！
That was… uh… yeah! Still got a long ways to go, I guess! Wow!
唉...呃...也对，\n我还有很长的路要走。
I’ll remember that one for a long time to come, lemme tell you. Gonna keep training, keep moving, keep working my way up the ladder.
我会记住这两场战斗，\n会继续加倍努力地训练，\n继续前进，继续向着更高爬去。
Glad to see you. Keep rocking, 'kay? Can’t wait for the rematch!
总之，继续加油吧，\n期待我们下一次的比试！
Same here.
我也是
Oh, I care.
我要赢
Won't go easy on you.
我不会手下留情
We don't have to fight.
我们未必要打
Good luck.
祝你好运
Good idea.
好主意
Don't.
别这样
Mavis...
梅维斯…
[Map318]
\PN, eh? How do ya spell that?
我不想再像前八年那样刻字了，
Don't want to have to redo the engraving like 8 years ago.
\PN你觉得行吗？
I've done what I set out to do: defeat every gym leader without losing a single 'mon, and never using any held items.
我已经完成那个了我的目标：\n在没有宝可梦被击败的情况下，\n战胜了所有道馆馆主，\n而且还没有携带任何道具。
So, I guess I can't be too mad about scrubbing out in the very first round of the tournament...
所以...我不应该\n因为第一轮就被淘汰，\n而感到太难过
I heard you got a first-round bye, and were seeded in the opposite bracket from mine.
我听说你被分到和我不同的小组了。
Means you'll get to avoid the guy who ended up sweeping me with his Serperior.
也就说你不会很快遇到\n那个用君主蛇横扫了我的人。
He kind of reminded me of you, actually.
实际上，他让我想起了你。
Anyways, I got time and I got frustration to vent. Battle me if you find yourself in the same situation.
总之，我现在有时间了，\n而且也想发泄一下挫败感。\n如果你需要训练的话，可以来找我。
Any fights between us now are just for the joy of battling. That persuasive enough, heh?
我们之间的所有对决，\n都只是为了纯粹的对战的乐趣，\n没错吧？
Understood.
明白了。
I'll be here until you wish to battle.
我会在这里等你的。
My redemption is imminent. Surely.
当然，我的救赎之道，\n或许就在其中。
Yeah, you're definitely like that guy I fought.
没错，你跟那个人很像。
Results were just as expected. I'm just happy it wasn't too lopsided.
预料之中的结果，\n好在没有被一边倒的击败。
There's a nurse down there in the main lobby.
下面的大厅里有个护士。
Hop on down there, and right back up to me so we can fight again, you hear?
下去，然后再回来，\n这样我们就可以再来一场了。
Golly gee, if it isn't the Champion of Makya.
哦吼，这不是马凯亚冠军吗？
I had great seats for watching that final battle.
我的座位位置还不错，\n能看到最后的战斗。
That dingus was related to you, after all!
而且你跟那个家伙是亲戚！
Quite a fight. The energy in the crowd was electric.
你们打得相当精彩，\n观众们都沸腾起来了。
Frankly I'm honored to have seen your illustrious victory in person!
说实话，我很荣幸能\n亲眼目睹你的辉煌胜利！
I'm going to take a break from traveling the region, and stick around here for a while.
我现在打算暂停自己的旅行，\n在这里住一段时间。
A couple of battles won't hurt, though. I'll be right here, if the desire strikes you.
如果你想的话，\n有空来打几场也行，我就在这里。
I even tweaked my team a little!
我甚至还稍微调整了一下我的队伍！
Champion, eh? I hope you don't feel above battling little 'ol me.
冠军？我不会觉得\n跟这个头衔的人交手\n有什么了不起的。
Wait. If I beat you now, do I become champion instead?
等下，如果我打赢了你，\n那我是不是就是冠军了？
That was a champion-tier victory, all right!
这是一场冠军级别的胜利！
If you still feel the need to prove yourself, the previous champions are all still in Makya.
如果你觉得有必要继续证明自己，\n以前的冠军们也都还在马凯亚。
Fighting them would be fun, I bet!
我觉得，跟他们打一打一定很有趣！
I avoided worrying about the Avatar Crisis during my gym challlenge. I don't think my skill set transfers too well to fighting them.
我一直投身于道馆挑战，\n也因此避免了跟化身危机的交集，\n而且我也不太适合跟它们战斗。
But I'm worried now, though.
所以我现在有些担心。
I bet people'll be falling over themselves to give you healing items, now.
我觉得现在会有很多人，\n争先恐后地送给你东西。
Not me, though, I still gotta do things the old fashioned way. I'll need time to do that, if you don't mind.
但我不会这么做，\n还是得按老办法来。\n你不介意的话，稍微给我点时间。
Nothing like a warmup scrim before the next round!
在下一轮比试前，\n最好热一下身！
The battles that take place each year are nothing short of inspirational!
每年，这里的对决都令人感到振奋！
I may be a painter, but battling is my second form of art!
我是一个画家，\n同时也是战斗的艺术家！
Fantastic! Marvelous! Outstanding!
太棒了！简直难以置信！
Your style is so graceful, so forceful, so majestic! You deserve the title of champion!
你的风格是如此优雅，\n如此雄壮有力，\n你无愧于冠军的称号！

It matters not! We will fight through with pure determination!
但这不重要，\n我们将坚定不移地战斗下去！
I hope no funky business goes down during the competition.
我希望竞技大会期间，\n不要再出什么幺蛾子了。
Outside of that weird quake, it was business as usual.

Another successful day of guard duty.

The peeps on the TV are saying that the Avatar Crisis is over now.
我看电视里的人说，\n化身危机已经结束了。
I bet you ain't got much to spend your time on, therefore.
我想，现在你是不是闲下来了。
Wanna just keep fighting me? I collected a ton of different Pokemon during this journey, so I have a lot of teams I want to try out.
想要继续跟我战斗吗？\n在这次的旅程中，\n我收集了很多不同的宝可梦，\n我也想试试不同的队伍。
Ooh, to spice it up, I should switch to different teams between battles. A surprise every time!
哦，对了，为了增添情趣，\n我每场战斗都会用不同的队伍，\n保证能给你些惊喜！
Yeah, I really love the sound of that.
没错，我喜欢这种感觉。
Plus, I've stocked up on enough medicine at this point to afford healing up your team between bouts.
另外，我也准备好了足够的药品，\n可以在战斗间隙为你疗伤。
Lame.
略略略。
And here I put so much effort into preparing all these different parties...
我明明为了你\n准备了这么多不同的队伍...
Let's get into it!

I can tell she's THIS close to evolving. We'll be unstoppable when we get a team together.
我能看得出，她快要进化了，\n指我们齐心协力，就势不可当。
Just you wait! Minccino and I are gunning for your spot!
等着瞧吧，\n我和泡沫栗鼠会夺走你的位子的！
Can't let my team get cold, even for just a second!
我不会让它们的状态冷下来，\n哪怕是只有一秒钟！
The battle strategies that all the Trainers here use are so complex.
这里的训练家都会\n使用一些比较复杂的战术。
Swap in! Swap out! Chip damage! Baiting moves!
比如换人，持续伤害，\n保护类招式等等！
It makes my head dizzy...
听得我头有点晕...
My old rival once set up his sweeper even though I had no chance to recover.
我的老对手曾在我毫无准备的时候，\n将我在赛场外横扫出局了。
"Why did you set up on me?" I asked, "I was already walled."
“你干嘛，诶哟？”我问他，\n“我还没准备好！”
My rival smiled, "You were swept before the game started; the set up is the whole point."
他只是笑着说：\n“在比赛开始前你就没有资格了，\n准备工作才是重中之重。”
One night while meditating, I was approached by a Chasm grunt who demanded my possessions: my items, my Pokemon, the shirt off my back.
那天晚上，我正在冥想，\n一个裂隙队的人过来，索要财物，\n把我的道具、宝可梦和衣服都抢走了。
I quickly complied. Now naked and cold, I resumed meditation.
我并没有反抗他，\n而是赤身裸体，继续冥想。
"My poor fellow," I said to myself, "I wish I could give you my skill, too."
“的确我现在失去了财富”，\n我对自己这样说，\n“但他抢不走我的技术。”
My old rival predicted my every swap until I became afraid to pivot.
我的老对手每次都能猜中，\n我要换哪只宝可梦。
"How do you guess correctly every time?" I asked.
“为什么你总能猜到？”我问他。
My old rival smiled. "I limit your options until you have only one choice," my rival replied.
他笑着回答道：\n“我会限制你的可选项，\n当你只有一个选项可行时，
"And then you have no choice at all."
这个选择就是必然。”
"Why do you play worse the closer you get to the finish line?" my old rival asked.
“为什么你越接近终点时，\n发挥得越差呢？”\n我的老对手这么问我。
I thought for a moment and replied, "because I'm afraid to lose."
我想了一会儿，答道：\n“因为我害怕失败。”
My old rival smiled. "Are you sure you're not afraid to win?"
他笑着问我：\n“那你就不怕赢吗？”
I met my old rival at a petting zoo. He was talking with one of the baby Skiddo and struggling to hold back tears.
那次我在宠物园区\n遇到了我的老对手，\n他正努力忍着眼泪，\n跟一只小坐骑山羊说话。
I asked him, "are you doing okay, friend?"
我问他：“你还好吗，伙计？”
He shook his head solemnly. "Everyone forgets that goats are herd animals. We're not meant to be alone."
他郑重地摇了摇头：\n“大家都忘了山羊是群居动物，\n我们注定不会孤独。”
"I'm playing terribly," I told my old rival. "I'm not going to win."
“我表现得很差，”我对他说，\n“我赢不了...”
"This too shall pass," he replied.
“都会过去的。”他这样回应。
That night I beat the gym and raced to tell him, "Thank you for your advice. I cannot tell you how happy I am right now."
那天晚上，我挑战了道馆，\n然后高兴地告诉他：\n“谢谢你的建议，\n我没办法表达现在有多高兴。”
My old rival smiled. "This too shall pass."
然后他笑着说：\n“都会过去的。”
Ugh, a year of training and I'm out in the first round.
呃，一年的训练，结果第一轮就出局了。
Wish I qualified for one of the byes...

I went and purchased a Shiny Stone to pull out an Aegislash later, but I guess I don't have a use for it anymore.
我去买了一颗闪光石，想以后用来获得坚盾剑怪，但现在我似乎用不上了。

嗯，那就继续努力吧，对吧？最坏的情况下，明年还有机会。
O-oh. I hope you'll feel better soon.
哦，希望你很快就会感觉好些。
Or was that like, an ego thing? Well, I suppose I'm not in a spot to say anything about that...
还是出于自我吹嘘的原因吗？嗯，我想我没有资格对此发表任何意见……
I think I'll just hang out here and catch up on the matches later.
我想我会在这里闲逛，稍后再看比赛的情况。
Gotta reset the mental, you know?
需要重置一下心态，你知道吗？
Haha! You won! You won!
哈哈！你赢了！你赢了
Incredible!

Always a doozy getting our equipment set up.
这些设备安装起来太麻烦了。
I swear, a fifth of each year's budget just goes towards replacing stuff that got hit by a stray Hydro Pump or Fire Blast...
每年都得花费五分之一的预算，\n用来更换被水或火属性招式\n击中的各种零件...
I bet right every round, only to lose it all on the last round...

一个电属性的宝可梦就足够了，\n如果你有，我可以用\n当地特有的的尖牙笼跟你交换\n（在箱子里选择宝可梦）。

该死，看来必须要冒点险了。
Dang, thought I had a break here. Come back if you ever get your hands on an Electric-type.

With my bird Pokemon, I thought that Avatar of Maractus would be a chump.
我以为我的鸟类宝可梦，\n能轻松击败沙铃仙人掌的化身。
It turned Steel-type in the middle of the fight! That's not fair!

At first I journeyed here not knowing why, or what I hoped to find. I simply knew I must.

And then... then it fell upon me like some grim scavenger upon a fresh corpse.

I do not know if I ever did. Countless possibilities plagued me in sleepless hours.
我不确定自己\n是否曾经想过这种可能性，\n在我失眠的时候，\n有太多想法一直困扰着我。

I need your support, and I know your adamant core resides within your abilities as a trainer.

More than that, I know it is how you judge people. I would have you witness my soul, and know the truth.
更重要的是，\n我知道这是你评判人的方式，\n我想让你见证我的灵魂，获知真相。
Do what you must. I may wait a few moments longer... may keep the past at bay.
随你自己的意愿去做吧，\n我可以再等一会儿…\n可以让过去晚一些来。

I remember the house, the old hardwood, the ticking of the grandfather clock, the smell of the river loam!
我想起了那栋房子，\n那些古老的硬木地板，\n那座老爷钟的滴答声，\n那河边泥土的气味！
The crushing of the drying autumn leaves, the warmth of a soft embrace, the bruising, the bleeding, the burning, the fight!
那些被踩碎的秋叶，\n柔软拥抱的温暖，\n那些伤、血、燃烧还有争斗！
The love of the fight! The yearning to learn, to become something more!

I remember her. I remember Imogene teaching us, teaching all of us... teaching us to be...

Go on ahead.
你先走吧。
Find what has happened to my sister in this torment.
去找出我姐妹\n在这场灾难中发生了什么。
I... I will release our Pokémon, and then I will cease this long masquerade.

Leave me. I must do this alone.
让我一个人离开吧。
There’s a note.

She trained them not only in battle, but to imitate humans. To imitate... her.

I found it so curious, to see Pokémon pretending to be people. How lovely. How fun!
我觉得很奇妙，\n看到宝可梦假装成人类，\n多么可爱，多么有趣！
She took me in as if I was just another pink blob, and she taught me more than I can express, let alone repay.
她像对待我的方式，\n也像对待她们一样，\n她教给我很多东西，\n我无法一一列举，更无以为报。
I am not her, nor is my companion. We are but two mirrors set facing each other, endlessly reflecting a woman that is gone.
我不是她，我的姐妹也不是...\n我们只是两面镜子，\n不停地照出一个已经离去的女人。
We strayed further and further in our imitations every day. It could not last. Do not mourn for us.
我们每天都在\n越来越远的模仿中迷失自己，\n这本就不能永远持续下去，\n不要为我们而感到悲伤。
This is the truth, and it provides suffering and succor in equal measure, as it always does.
这就是真相，\n它带来了同等的痛苦和安慰，\n一如既往。
We are released from our bonds. We are Imogene no longer.
我们不再受到束缚，\n我们不再是伊莫珍。
Now we are Imogene, sisters of a name, and that is all.

or if, perhaps, Imogene was not the saint I remember her as.
或者，也许伊莫珍\n也不是我记忆中的圣人。
In either case, I will take responsibility for what I have done.

It is the least I can do... and the best I can imagine.”
这是我能做的最少的事情...\n也是我能想到的最好的事情。”

The infinitely-mutable Pokémon of myth, here in the flesh.
它就等在这里，\n活生生地出现在面前。
It chitters happily, swimming through the air.
它欢快地吟唱着歌谣，\n在空中游曳。
Yet, somehow, there’s a macabre tinge to its movements, a slight touch of gallows humor to the way it darts around gravestones.
然而，不知怎么的，\n它的动作带着一丝可怕的气息，\n它在墓碑周围飞来飞去，\n嘴角还带着一丝笑意。
There is a flash of sympathy in its eyes when it stares into yours.
当它凝视着你的时候，\n它的眼中闪过一丝同情。
It knows what it is, and it knows what you are, and you know what it is.
它知道它是谁，\n也知道你是谁，\n同时你也知道它是谁。

它停下动作，漂浮在空中，\n用它充满活力的眼睛凝视着你。
You see the conflict in its eyes –

the desire to explore free and wide, the remembered thrill of the fight, the eagerness to repay its debt, the desire to accompany you.
探索自由和广阔的渴望，\n对激烈战斗的回忆，\n偿还自己错误的渴望，\n以及陪伴你的愿望。

有时它会失踪，\n漫游于各种风景和思绪之中。
Sometimes in the witching hour objects will move on their own.

Sometimes you find notes written in handwriting you can’t read, signed with a question mark.
有时你会发现\n用你看不懂的字体所写的便条，\n签名都是一个问号。
You know it can leave any time it likes. It won’t.
你知道它可以随时离开，\n但它不会不辞而别。
It flips upside down, then rights itself in mid-air.
它翻转过来，\n然后在半空中恢复了平衡。
Perhaps mockery, perhaps a nod, perhaps just an idle motion of a recently-freed animal.
也许是嘲弄，也许是赞许，\n也许只是一个\n刚刚释怀的生物的闲散动作。
Then, it’s gone.
然后，它就消失了。
A mirage that disappears with a strong breeze, dispelled like a waking dream.
像初醒的梦境一样，\n随着一阵强风消散了。
If you come back, perhaps it will be here, waiting for you. They’ll say this place is haunted, but you know the truth.
如果你回来找它，\n也许它还会在这里等你，\n人们会传言这个地方闹鬼，\n但只有你知道真相。
It’s always liked graveyards, and it can afford to wait to make sure you won’t need it.
它一直喜欢墓地，\n而且它有足够的时间等待，\n以确保你确实不需要它。
Now, it has nothing but time.
现在，有的只剩时间了。

But I’m going to try my best, and if I make it close, I’ll be happy.
但是我也会尽力而为，\n如果我能让比赛变得焦灼，\n也算是不虚此行了。
Sometimes you just gotta say “well, I’m not the best person in the room, but that isn’t gonna stop me.”
那句话怎么说的来着：\n“无法取得桂冠，\n也要一往无前。”
Um. Yeah. So, uh, I don’t know if you noticed, but… this isn’t my Phione.
差不多吧，记不太清了...\n嗯...另外...\n我不知道你是否注意到了...\n这不是我的霏欧纳。
Yeah. So, uh, my Phione laid an egg, and that egg hatched into this li’l thing.
我的霏欧纳下了一个蛋，\n然后这个小东西就孵化出来了。
My Phione’s napping right now, but this rascal is full of energy.
至于我的那只现在在睡觉，\n而这个家伙则充满了活力。
This one’s a bit more feisty. It’s got this, I don’t know, devil-may-care attitude.
这个小家伙更加好斗，\n它有那种...应该是...\n参加魔鬼训练的觉悟？
My Phione’s pretty chill. Maybe it’ll mellow with age? This one just hatched, so who knows.
而我的霏欧纳要冷静很多，\n也许这跟年龄有关？\n毕竟这只刚孵化出来。
Yeah, no worries. I didn’t really expect you to.
哈哈，我明白，\n我也没指望你能分清。
This little rascal just hatched from an egg – my Phione’s a bit more chill, a bit more mellow. This one’s a real fighter.
这个小家伙刚从蛋里孵化出来，\n我的霏欧纳更加冷静，温和，\n而这只是一个真正的斗士。
No, no, mine is napping. This is a newly-hatched Phione, complete with youthful rebellious attitude.
没有，它现在在睡觉，\n这是一个新孵化的霏欧纳，\n有着年轻人独有的叛逆。
Which, y’know, cool, I guess.
怎么说...这...也挺酷的？
But, uh, yeah. I’ve got a spare Phione.
总之...呃...\n这只霏欧纳现在并没有主人。
I don’t know how useful the squirt will be to you, but if you want it, I’d be more than happy to give it to you. I know you’ll care for it.
我不知道这它能对你有多大帮助，\n只要你想要它，\n我也乐意把它给你，\n我知道你能照顾好它。
I hope it helps you out somewhere, sometime. It’s looking for a fight. I know it.
希望它能在某个时候帮到你，\n毕竟它也在寻求一场战斗，\n就像它一直表现出来的样子。
No? Alright, well, maybe you’ll get a second chance if you change your mind.
不打算带上它？\n好吧，如果你改主意了，\n也许还会有第二次机会。
Anyways, yeah, tournament is kicking off, so bye for now. Maybe I’ll see you in there.
总之，竞技大会要开始了，\n就此别过，或许我们会在赛场重逢。
Hope so. And then – oh, yeah, I almost forgot. My Phione’s been wanting to visit the water recently.
然后...哦对，我差点忘了！\n我的霏欧纳最近想去水边。
I just... I know it. It needs something. Somewhere special.
我只是...我知道...\n它应该想要某些东西...\n去某个特别的地方。
I’ve heard about some kind of deep spring or river or something around the <imp>base of the Eleig river</imp>.
我听说在<imp>埃利格河附近</imp>\n有一眼地下深泉。
I’m gonna try and find it after the Championship wraps up. I owe it to Phione.
等竞技大会结束后，\n我就会去试着寻找它，\n毕竟我还欠霏欧纳一个人情。
So... yeah. So long, friend. Hope I’ll see you around.
那么...就这样了，朋友，\n回头再见。
Take the Phione.
带上霏欧纳。
Don't take the Phione.

A solid tip! Make sure your team compositions are up to snuff if you want to take 'em out.

The best defense is a good offense, am I right? Just gotta start a stampede to take one of them down.

You heard it here folks! Stock your Aid Kits and keep at it.
大家听到了吗！\n备好急救包，继续努力。
W-what? You mean like, the avatars are causing you duress? Profound. I think.

Alright, last question. If you could say one thing to your fans at home, what would it be?

You have heeded Yezera’s invitation even should it bring you into the most dismal abysm of this entire region.
你接受了叶泽拉的邀请，\n即便这会把你\n带到这个地区最凄凉的深渊。
Do you fancy yourself a hero? Do you bear a grudge? Or are you enamored with the idea of facing a former Champion?
你认为自己是英雄吗？\n还是对某些事情怀恨在心？\n或者只是想要面对一位前冠军？
Pray, do not tell me. I would delight in divining the answer myself.

You’re late, kid. Ain’t got no manners, keepin' a lady waitin' like that.
你迟到了，小家伙。\n让女士等待很没礼貌。
Hah! Ain’t talkin' 'bout myself – meant Yez.
哈！我说的女士不是自己，\n而是叶泽拉。
Don'tcha gimme that smile. She’s right fine when she’s dolled up, and more than that, she’s my friend.
收起你这份笑意，\n她打扮得好的时候很好看，\n而且她是我的朋友。
You’re gonna give her your respect, y'hear me?

Now, got some bad news for ya: I ain’t lettin' you have your last dance with her if I can help it. This ends now.
现在，我有些坏消息告诉你：\n如果我能阻止的话，\n我不会让你和她最后起舞，\n到这里就结束了。

'Cause you’re sweet and oh-so-polite, I ain’t gonna break anything.
不过，因为你的礼貌，\n我不会打伤你。
But you’re pickin’ a fight with Yez, so I’m gonna leave you with some bruises. You 'bout ready? Put ‘em up, kid.
但你毕竟在阻挠叶泽拉，\n那就留下一些淤青吧。\n准备好了吗？放马过来吧。
Ah, you’re such a babyface. Real cute one, too.
啊，你的脸真的很和我的胃口。
Kinda kid you take home to meet your parents, y’know? Shame I’m gonna have to put you six feet under.
我挺想把你带回去见父母的，\n但现在我得让你下地狱。
Hah! I kid, I kid – I ain’t doin’ wetwork. Anymore.
哈哈！我开玩笑的，\n我不会再做得那么极端了。
I ain’t lettin’ you get away without a few bruises, though. Ready? Go!
但是我也不会让你\n毫发无损地离开，\n准备好了吗？
Hey – listen, she’s – don’tcha try goin’ and flusterin’ me.
你...听着，她...\n别让我分神。
Had to haul that girl to prom, mind ya, and she wears a nice dress a mite better than yours truly.
每次不得不带她去舞会时...\n她穿上礼服都比我好看多了。
My point is that’s she’s a right fine lady, and ya better respect her like one.
总之，要把她当做女孩子看待，\n像对待一位女士一样尊重她。
Agh, ya got me distracted. Quit with the psyops and fight me proper.
啊，我不该分心想这些...\n别用心理战术了，跟我好好打。
Hah! Whatever you say, kid. I ain’t 'bout to take that metaphor and run with it.
哈！随你怎么说，\n我只不过是做个比喻罢了。
You want to get to her, ya go through me. Call me cliche but that’s my line about it.
你想接近她，\n就得先过我这关，\n虽然老套，但这就是我的底线。
I guess ya could say I’m reserving the first dance. Hah!
你也可以说，\n我是在准备序曲，哈哈！
I like you, kid. C’mere. Lemme beat that humor out of you.
说实话我挺喜欢你的，\n但现在得把你的幽默打出来了。
Hello there. You arrived just a teensy bit earlier than I expected – I was writing a poem, see. Never to be finished, tragically.
你好，你来得...\n比我预期中要早一些...\n我正在写一首诗，\n可惜永远无法完成了。
These black arches of stone like a starless sky will soon be replaced by brilliant alabaster, which, well, ruins the central symbolism.
这黑色的拱门像是没有星星的夜空，\n很快就要被华丽的雪花石膏所代替，\n可这却破坏了中心的象征意义。
What a shame. I assume you’re going to force me to duel you now?
真可惜，我猜...\n你现在要逼我跟你决斗了吧？
You march into my demesne, hauling your well- trained combat creatures with you.
你闯进我的领地，\n带着你训练有素的战斗宠物。
We’ve fought before. You’re completely opposed to my beautiful dream. And you still want to claim I have a choice in the matter?
我们以前就交过手了，\n你还反对我的美好梦想，\n我又怎么有选择的权力呢？
Don’t insult me. You’ve made your choice, and now we have to deal with the consequences.
不要侮辱我了。\n你已经做出了选择，\n现在我们必须承担相应的后果。
Ah, well. At least you’re honest. I like that about you. You’ve got such... clarity.
好吧，至少你很诚实，\n我喜欢你这一点，\n喜欢你如此清晰的思路。
What a gleaming light in this dreary cave. Why, that could almost be poetic! If only we had a hopeless romantic to write that down.
在这个阴暗的洞穴里，\n总有一束闪亮的光芒。\n这似乎也可以写成诗！\n如果我们能有一个陷入绝望的\n浪漫主义者来记录一切就好了。
Alas, I’ll be too busy directing my passions into carving your team apart.
唉，我不得不将我的激情\n投入到分化你的团队当中。
Of course! You’re such a brilliant spark in this region. You deserve odes... sonnets.
当然！你在这个地区\n是如此杰出的一束光，\n你应该得到颂歌…得到十四行诗。
On the other hand, the fact that you’re here now against me instead of alongside me means that you’re not as special as I thought.
另一方面，你现在站在我对面\n而不是和我并肩作战，\n这意味着你并不像我想象中那么特别。
No faith. It’s a shame, really! I don’t want to do this! But I will.
没有信仰，真是可惜！\n我不想这样做！但我必须要做。
And, since I have to... might as well enjoy it.
既然我这已经是定局…\n那就享受一下吧。
What? You think a poetic soul is creepy? Does true faith disturb you?
什么？\n你认为有诗意的灵魂很可怕吗？\n虔诚的信仰让你不安吗？
Genuine emotions uncompromised by the endless drudgery of society? Fine!
不被无休止的社会劳作所侵扰的\n真实情感让你感到不舒服了？
Enjoy where that narrow-minded view gets you. Namely: here, about to lose to me.
好吧，享受那种狭隘的看法吧。\n也就是说：你将在这里输给我。
Hello, friend.
你好，朋友。
We have already begun. Regigigas will quickly remake the world.
我们已经开始行动了，\n雷吉奇卡斯将很快重塑世界。
I understand that you are here to face Yezera, but unfortunately I can’t allow that.
我知道你来这里\n是为了见叶泽拉的，\n但很抱歉我不能允许。
There is a non-zero chance of your success, and I am not a gambler. If you would like, we can both stay here and talk until the reversion overtakes us.
你成功的几率接近于零，\n但我不是赌徒，不会选择放任。\n如果你愿意，我们可以一起\n待在这里，直到逆转影响到我们。
I supposed as much. Excuse me, but in that case I must fight you.
我也是这么觉得的。\n不好意思，但在现在这种情况，\n我必须和你战斗。
Universal knowledge is approaching. I would like to be there to witness it – alone, if possible.
真正的知识正在接近，\n我想在那里见证它...\n如果可能的话，我也想独自一人。
I do not either. Unfortunately, I can tell from your tone that we are, in fact, about to duel.
我也不想，不幸的是，\n我可以从你的语气中\n感觉到我们确实将要决斗。
I am unwilling to let you go further, and I am unwilling to lose. Please understand... and please consider conceding.
我不愿让你继续前进，\n也不愿输给你。\n请理解…并考虑认输吧。
That is the most I am willing to say pertaining to your odds against Yezera.
如果你要直面叶泽拉，\n这已经是保守的估计了。
She is conventionally regarded as unbeatable when she applies herself, though I am aware that you have broken that convention repeatedly.
只要她想，她就是无敌的，\n尽管我也听说了，\n你已经多次打破了惯例。
Now, may we end the discussion of theory and add another data point?
现在，我们可以结束理论讨论，\n再引入另一部分数据吗？
Excuse my verbosity. If you would like to go straight to our duel, we can.
请原谅我啰嗦，\n如果你想直接进行决斗，\n那就来吧。
I would not insult your intelligence by pretending we will not fight. That much should be evident.
我不会侮辱你的智慧，\n假装我们不会打架，\n那没有什么意义。
Shall we?
开始吧？
Oh, uh, hey. Listen: I’m gonna cut right to the chase.
哦...嗯...我直奔主题了。
You beat me once. You beat Yezera, um, a lot.
你曾经打败过我，\n也打败了叶泽拉，\n嗯...很多次。
Though, some of those don’t really count, 'cause she was using someone else’s team and – whatever.
虽然其中一些场次，\n因为她用了别人的队伍，\n或者其他什么原因而不能算数。
Point is, I can’t beat you. But… I gotta try. I’ve got a lot to answer for, y’know?
但问题是，我打不过你，\n也还是...必须尝试。\n我有很多问题要解决。
Lotta little things I did that I got to make up for. Can’t you just let me have this?
我必须去弥补自己曾经的过错，\n你就不能让我得到这个机会吗？
Of course you can’t. Can’t let me have anything, can you?
没错，我知道是这个答案，\n你什么都不会让给我。
Ugh, I was gonna be Champion! I was really gunning for it, too. And then... yeah. Everything.
我本来那么努力，\n就要成为冠军的！\n但是...没错，一切都玩了！
You completely overshadow me in every way. I can’t beat you. But I’m gonna try to hurt you.
你很多方面都超过我了，\n我打不过你，但我会用其他方式！
Maybe to you. But not to them – not to Pokémon. They’re the ones who have to forgive me.
对你来说可能是这样，\n但对它们来说不是...\n不是对宝可梦来说，\n是那些必须原谅我的人。
It’s time for them to stop taking orders and start being treated like equals. That includes from ace trainers like you.
是时候让他们不再接受命令，\n被平等对待了。\n这也包括像你这样的顶尖训练家。
I know you can’t stand that, so... I guess we gotta fight. Sorry... but I’m not sorry.
我知道你不能容忍这一点，\n所以...我想我们得打一架，\n抱歉...但我不后悔。
I don’t. Not most of the time anyways.
大多数时候我不会这样。
I’m trying my best to make things right. Can you say the same? Going around keeping the status quo?
我正在尽我最大的努力\n去改正曾经的错误，\n你敢说这样的话吗？\n你只是在维持现状。
Is this the world you want? I guess you’re a rich brat, so... yeah. Life’s easy, life’s good.
这是你想要的世界吗？\n你是个富家子弟，所以...\n没错，没有压力，生活美好。
Hmph. I’m gonna try and make it a little harder for you, if I can.
哼，如果可以的话，\n我会让你的生活变得更艰难一些。
Sorry. Guess I’m a spiteful bastard.
抱歉，或许我就是个恶毒的混蛋。
No! I’ll fail – I’ll gladly fail – but I’m not about to give up. I’ve got friends that need protecting.
不！我会失败的...\n我很乐意失败...但我不会放弃。\n我有需要保护的朋友。
I’ve got stuff in my past I need to make up for. And I’ve got a world that needs building.
我有需要去弥补的过去，\n有需要去建设的世界。
A better one – one that’s more equal, more fair. Sorry it isn’t what you want, but I won’t just roll over for you.
一个更好的世界...\n一个更加平等、公正的世界。\n对，这不是你想要的，\n但我不会因此而屈服。
You ready?
准备好了吗？
...Hey. So, uh, this is it, huh?
...嘿。这在这里了，对吧？
You’re, like, not gonna have a change of mind? No justice? No fairness? No punishment?
你不会...大概...改变主意对吗？\n忽略了正义、公平和惩罚？
Oh, who am I kidding – you’re Tamarind’s lapdog. You’ve been doing her dirty work since, like, literally day one!
呵，是我看走眼了...\n你就是塔玛琳的走狗，\n大概...从一开始就在为她做事！
Guess what that means! That’s right: time to pay!
你知道这意味着什么吗？\n没错：是时候付出代价了！
That’s what they all said. You’re not a team grunt! You’re just, like, a temporarily inconvenienced mastermind!
没错，他们也这么说，\n你不是这个团队的普通士兵，\n你...大概...是个...\n暂时失去权势的策划者！
Ugh, you’re all the same. Well, I’ve chewed through a lotta grunts. No different this time!
呵，你们都一样，\n我已经干掉了很多士兵了，\n这次也不会有有什么例外！
Nope! But I really really want to!
不，我真的真的很想打你！
Tamarind’s out of my reach, but you’re, like, the second-best thing. So c’mere so I can give you a bloody nose.
既然我打不到塔玛琳，\n那你就是最好的选择，\n过来让我揍你一顿。
If you were sorry you’d stop fighting me, idiot!
如果你真的抱歉，\n就别再继续了，白痴！
You’re such a – such a dolt! How can I get it through your thick skull that you’re the bad guy? Can I beat it into you? Wanna find out?
你真是个...蠢货！\n我怎么才能让你明白你是坏人？\n我能把这些打进你的脑袋里吗？
Oh, I swear, I’ll roll up these sleeves and deck you myself if I have to! I swear, if you chip my nails I’m gonna kill you for real!
如果必须的话，\n我会卷起袖子亲自揍你！\n如果弄坏了我的指甲，\n我甚至会杀了你！
C’mon, boys and girls! We’ve got a beatdown to give!
来吧，我的同伴们！\n我们要打败他们！
Ah. Hah. Hahaha!
啊。哈，哈哈哈！
So be it! My reading is complete – the scars of this battle left in the ancient stone here are a portent of things to come.
就这样吧！预言已经完成了...\n这场战斗在这里留下的，\n这些古老石头上的伤痕，\n就是未来的预兆。
Can you suppose what it says? It says I shall lose here, and you shall triumph.
你能猜到它说了什么吗？\n它说我会失败，你会获胜。
Hah! Fate has a sense of humor, it seems.
哈！命运似乎有一种幽默感。
Go on. Continue yet deeper. I know my place, and will not stand against destiny any longer.
继续吧，去更深处。\n我知道我的位置，\n不会再违抗命运了。
For my sanity, I will refrain from attempting to divine the results of your future battles. I take my leave.
为了我的理智，\n我将不再尝试预测\n你未来战斗的结果。\n告辞。
Awww, kid, you shouldn’t have.
哦，你不该这样。
Goin’ all-out? On yours truly? I’m touched. Not even half-honest, either – it’s a treat seein’ you fight.
你对我全力以赴了？\n我觉得连一半都没有，\n你完全就是在享受战斗。
Go on. Yez is waitin’ for you. I ain’t too hung up on this whole scheme. Yez’ll turn out fine either way – tough girl.
继续吧，叶泽拉在等你，\n我对计划是否成功并不在意，\n无论结局如何，\n叶泽拉都会变成一个勇敢的女孩。
Tougher than me, I swear. So you go do what ya got planned, whatever that is.
一定...比我更坚强，\n所以你去做你计划中的事情吧，\n无论那是什么。
If ya hurt her, they’ll never find the body, blah blah blah, you know the drill.
还有如果你敢伤害她，\n尸体永远都不会被找到，\n吧啦吧啦吧啦，你知道我要说什么。
Good luck, kid. Come find me some time afterwards, y’hear?
祝你好运吧，之后再来找我。
...Go. Leave. Now, before I lose my temper.
...走吧，现在就走吧。\n在我发火之前走。
Is that really what the fate of the universe hangs on? Our relative skill in training Pokémon?
宇宙的命运真的取决于\n我们训练宝可梦的招式吗？
It’s ridiculous! It’s idiotic! I can’t believe – go! Just go! I should... I should... go.
这太荒谬了！太愚蠢了！\n我简直不敢相信...\n走！走！我应该…\n我应该…走！
Noted. Excuse me – I fear I may not have provided adequate resistance. I now find myself lacking any means to challenge you.
我知道了，请原谅我...\n我根本没有提供足够的力量，\n我发现自己没有任何挑战你的手段。
...Understood. I have no recourse but to retreat. I wish you the worst of luck in your future endeavors.
…明白了，\n我别无选择，只能撤退，\n祝你接下来厄运缠身。
If you will permit me to leave, I will no longer impede your progress.
如果你允许我离开，\n我不会再阻碍你的进展。
Goodbye, friend. I hope never to see you again.
再见...还是别再见的好。
Damn it. Damn it!
该死！该死！
I – yeah, that’s how it goes. Never was as good as you. Any of you hotshots.
我...对，就是这样。\n我从来不像你们那样厉害。
Pushed my Pokémon hard to try and get there, and now look at me. Trying to make up for all of it.
我努力训练我的宝可梦，\n试图达到那个水平，\n现在...试图弥补所有过错。
Sorry, everyone. Sorry, Manaphy. I guess that was it.
对不起，大家。\n对不起，玛纳霏。\n我想那就是结局了。
Let’s get y’all back to a Pokécenter, OK? Get you fixed up... I’m sorry...
让我们把你们\n送回宝可中心，好吗？\n让你们恢复过来…我很抱歉…
Ugh! I’m – fine! Ow. I think I took a stray shot... oof.
呃！我...没事！\n哎，我想我挨了一枪…
Look me in the damn eyes, you dumb grunt! If I was – ow – if I wasn’t... if I wasn’t... I’m feeling a little lightheaded.
看着我的眼睛，你这个愚蠢的家伙！\n如果我不是...呃...\n如果我不是...我...有点头晕...
Is this why they black out after losing...? I’m gonna... I can’t do this.
这就是他们输掉之后...\n会晕倒的原因吗？\n我...我要...我不行...
Go do whatever it is you think you’re, like, actually accomplishing. You stupid, stupid dolt...
你这个榆木脑袋...\n去做...大概...你想做的吧...
But you’re pickin’ a fight with Yez, so I’m gonna leave you with some bruises. You 'bout ready? Put 'em up, kid.
但你毕竟在阻挠叶泽拉，\n那就留下一些淤青吧。\n准备好了吗？放马过来吧。
You want to get to her, ya go through me. Call me cliché but that’s my line about it.
你想接近她，\n就得先过我这关，\n虽然老套，但这就是我的底线。
I should’ve known she was useless.
我早就该想到她没用了。
Yezera was THIS close. So close to getting everything she wanted. All she had to do was not tell you.
叶泽拉就差一点，就差一点，\n如果她没有告诉你，\n那就能得到一切了。
She had to not be human. Her one redeeming quality: her inhumanity. And now she went and betrayed that, and with it, me.
她就不该是人类，\n她唯一的可取之处，\n就是她身上非人性的成分。\n现在她背叛了它，也背叛了我。
Apparently. It’s sickening, to be honest.
外表上或许吧，\n但实际上有够恶心的。
The same shallow, stupid desires as everyone else. I guess I’m just as much of an idiot for believing in her.
和其他人一样，\n只有肤浅、愚蠢的欲望，\n我想我和她一样都是个白痴。
Yes. Good. For. Her.
对对对，很好。为她高兴。
Unfortunately, it isn’t so good for her grand plan, nor mine. I hope the catharsis is worth it.
但这无论是对她的，\n还是我的计划都不是好事，\n希望这种宣泄是值得的。
Yes, she did. I’m glad you’ve realized that.
是的，她做到了，\n我很高兴你能意识到这一点。
Fine. I hope I never see you again.
好吧，希望永远不会再见到你。
But, well, I’ll take care of her once the regression is complete.
但是，结束之后，\n我会照顾她的。
You, on the other hand, I’ll deal with now. So long.
但你，我现在就得处理掉，\n就这样再见吧。
Do you want me to dispose of your team again? Go on ahead. I can delay you all day.
想让我再处理你一次吗？\n来吧，想多少次都可以。
No!
不！
I want it! I want it so badly!
我需要它！我非常需要它！
I’d – you don’t understand. You don’t understand at all.
我会…你不明白，\n你什么都不明白。
How sickened I am at you creatures.
你们这些生物让我感到恶心。
Fine. You win. Go rendezvous with Yezera.
好吧，你赢了。\n去和叶泽拉会合吧。
I hope she puts you in your place.
我希望她能让你明白自己的位置。
If you ever see me again, it won’t end well for one of us.
如果再见面，\n对我们谁来说都不会好过。
I'm getting the hell out of here.
我要走了。
No.
不。
Yes.
是的。
You stopping me?
你要阻止我？
Get out of my way.
让开
You think you can?
你觉得你能？
Please, just shut up.
闭嘴吧
Yeah, it does.
那好吧
Don't wanna do this.
我不想这样
"Dolled up?"
打扮好的？
I'll dance if I want to.
能否起舞由我决定
Not forcing you.
我没有强迫你
Yeah, I am.
对，来吧
A poem? For me?
给我的诗？
Still creepy, huh?
还是很恶心
Not happening.
不可能
Don't want to fight.
我不想打架
Wait, "non-zero?"
接近于零？
Talked too long already.
说够了吧
No, I can't.
不行
This is wrong.
这是错的
Don't hate yourself.
不要自怨自艾
Just give up.
放弃吧
I'm not her lapdog.
我不是她的手下
Do we have to?
必须这样做？
Sorry.
对不起
Fine, bring it on.
那就来吧
She's human.
她是人类
Good for her.
她做得很好
Yeah, she did.
她做到了
Shut up. For good this time.
闭嘴，是时候算账了
[Map341]

\PN.
\PN.
Y’know, I pretty much assumed this was going to be a trap, but I didn’t think you’d be here.
我一开始就觉得这是个陷阱，\n但没想到你会在这里。
Well... whatcha doing? Care to explain?
嗯…能解释一下你在做什么吗？
What? You want me to explain this? Velenz? *shrug*
什么？我解释这个？\n夜幽市？*耸肩*
Oh, I know. But you’re the one standing in front of me.
嗯，我能猜到，\n但现在你是站在我面前的那个人。
Cute. Never should’ve brought a hero here. Heroes are always trouble.
笑话。\n永远不要把英雄主义带到现实中，\n英雄总是会给大家添麻烦。
*snort* Sure, kid. Whatever you say.
*哼* 随便吧，孩子，\n你说什么就是什么。
I know you’re here with that girl – Candy? Helena’s had her trackers keeping an eye on her for a while now.
我知道你和那个...\n叫糖儿的女孩在这里。\n海伦娜已经注意她很长时间了。
She hasn’t been causing too much trouble, though, so we let her go.
不过，她并未造成太多麻烦，\n所以我们也就没太在意。
Listen, we ran this region. Do you know what that means – taken any political science lately?
听着，我们统治着这个地区，\n你应该明白这意味着什么...\n你最学过政治学吗？
It means a monopoly on violence. Every government works the same way.
政治就是需要一些暴力手段，\n每个政府都是一样的。
Oh, you can call me a tyrant if you want, but I’m no thief.
你可以管我叫暴君，\n但我不是小偷。
Yep! And a damn good one.
而且还是一个非常出色的人。
Not an absolute one, though – Andris and Helena made up the other two corners of that triangle.
但也不是绝对的...\n安德里斯和海伦娜组成了\n这个地区的另外两个角。
Not to mention the extensive bureaucracy of Team Chasm at its height.
更别说裂隙队最鼎盛时期，\n那庞大且复杂的官僚系统了。
From who? This was a lawless frontier before we came along.
从谁那里夺走的？\n在我们来这里之前，\n马凯亚更是一个无法无天的地区。
Only holdouts like Novo truly resisted unification into the larger establishment.
除了最初望新镇的那群顽固分子，\n其他人都不抵触融入我们。
The benefits of being a tyrant. If people are getting in the way, you can convince them to... stop.
成为暴君的好处是什么？\n如果有人故意与你做对，\n你可以“说服”他们停下来。
C’mon. You were raised better than that.
呵，本以为你的家教会更好。
We still rule the region because we ARE the region.
我们仍然统治着这个地区，\n因为我们就是这个地区。
We’ve got old grunts everywhere who’ll still follow orders if I give them. Helena has her trackers, so we’ve got an intelligence agency.
这里的每一处土地上\n都有我们的老兵，\n只要一声令下，他们便会服从。\n海伦娜也有她自己的追随者，\n因此我们有了庞大的情报网络。
And she’s got her claws in LuxTech’s outpost here, so economic development is guided by us.
是她在光华市现在的位置\n创造了那座城市的一切，\n并依靠科技发展我们的经济。
We were a big organization. All-encompassing. And we had to be: lots of work to do.
我们是一个庞大的组织，\n无所不包，无所不有，\n因为我们必须得这样做。
Over just a few decades, we imposed law on this place, created entire new settlements, made it rich and vibrant.
我们用了仅仅几十年的时间，\n便在这里颁布了法律，\n创建了人类的聚落，\n使其变得富有且充满活力。
We quintupled the population. We dealt with outbreaks, infighting, earthquakes. We secured the support of multiple major companies.
这个过程中，\n马凯亚的人口增长了五倍，\n我们处理了疾病、自然灾害，\n还有一次又一次的内部纷争，\n并获得了多家大公司的支持。
And at the end of the day, we managed to go legit, integrate with the Prizcan government, and aren’t even hated for it.
并最终得以与宏礼市的政府融合，\n在将混乱控制在最小的情况下，\n让一切平稳过渡到现在这样。
If you want to try and do even a tenth of that without resorting to violence, be my guest.
如果你觉得想要达成这个目标，\n一点暴力都不需要使用，\n那就自己试试吧。
We punished people, which you’d call assault. We imprisoned them, which you’d call kidnapping. We taxed them, which you’d call theft.
我们对罪犯的惩罚被视为攻击，\n我们对他们的监禁被视为绑架，\n我们对他们征税被视为盗窃。
Oh, sure, people resisted us, but we only acted how a state does.
当然，有不少人反对过，\n但是国家的发展更加重要。
Candy’s too young to have been around during Chasm’s zenith.
糖儿她毕竟年纪小，\n没有经历过裂隙队的鼎盛时期。
She’s got a child’s notion of justice, and she thinks that performing her own little acts of violence fixes anything.
她对正义的概念像个孩子，\n认为自己的小暴力可以解决问题。
Maybe she should ask herself why almost everyone’s fine with us.
我觉得她应该问问自己，\n为什么几乎其他所有人\n都对我们很满意。
Yes.
没错。
Andris did it for money.
安德里斯是为了钱。
Helena did it for power.
海莲娜是为了权力欲。
And I did it so I could finally have the resources to properly research the Regis.
我这么做是为了\n能有足够的经费来研究巨人。
Everyone in Team Chasm – in any organization – has their own reasons to be there.
裂隙队里的每个人...\n不管在哪个组织中，\n他们都有自己的利益诉求。
...We can argue all day, kid. You’re not going to get anywhere.
...孩子，就这个问题，\n我们可以争论一整天，\n但不会有任何进展。
Let me put it this way:
这么说吧：
a lot of the Pokémon Candy has “rescued” were given to Chasm grunts for combat purposes, but they ended up liking their new home plenty fine.
糖儿所“拯救”的那些宝可梦，\n的确是因战斗目的而征收的，\n但它们也渐渐喜欢上了新的生活。
Maybe talking things out would’ve resolved things better than theft, huh?
你觉得它们真的\n想回到原主人身边吗？\n就算是，那谈判\n也比偷窃更容易解决问题。
But I know you want to know. What’s up with Velenz? Well, it’s simple. We were trying to work.
我知道你最关心的，\n还是夜幽市的情况对吧？
I can’t work when I’m being attacked by wannabe heroes. When the power grid is being fried. When Ghost-types are being sent to haunt my lab.
很简单，我们在正常工作的时候，\n被一些自称为英雄的人攻击了，\n他们烧毁了电网，\n并派出幽灵宝可梦去骚扰实验室。
We asked, repeatedly, for them to stop. They didn’t.
我们一次又一次地，\n要求他们停下来，但显然没什么用。
So I took Regigigas and had it carve up the bedrock around here, then dragged some avatars in for good measure.
所以我只能带着雷吉奇卡斯，\n去那里打通地下隧道，\n并创造出一些化身来保护设施。
They couldn’t prove it was us, but pretty soon they lost their base of operations, and that got the message across.
在我们反攻之后，\n他们很快就丢盔弃甲了，\n如今夜幽市的样子\n就是这一场骚乱的直接结果。
Yes. Was. If they’d wanted to keep it, they could’ve left us alone.
是的，过去是的。\n不过如果他们想保住它，\n只要不来打扰我们就可以了。
Kid, have you ever gotten twelve hours of sleep in a week?
你有过一周只睡\n12个小时的经历吗？
These “freedom fighters” were using every trick in the book. Constantly harrying us. Never a moment’s rest.
这些所谓的“自由战士”\n几乎把你能想到的诡计都用了一遍。\n在不断地骚扰下，\n我们很多人每天只能睡一两个小时。
Ugh. Makes me mad just thinking about it.
啊...想想就来气。
I think so, yeah.
我就说吧。
That’s how it goes. Warfare ain’t pretty, but it exists for a reason.
事实就是，战争并不美好，\n但它存在是有原因的。
I did what I did. And if someone wants to “bring me to justice” for it, I say: what does that even mean?
我只是做了自己该做的事，\n如果有人想要因此\n“将我绳之以法”，\n那我只想说：那又怎样？
I’m breaking my back running this region, making it better every day.
我正在努力经营这个地区，\n让它每天变得更好。
You want to throw me in prison? Make this place worse so you can have your petty revenge? Idiocy.
你要把我送进监狱吗？\n这只会让这个地方变得更糟，\n唯独满足了你小小的报复心。
I know what I did, and I’m not going to do it again. Neither is anyone else.
我很清楚以前做过些什么，\n但之后不会，也不需要再做了，\n当然其他人一样。
...Now, kid. I need to get out of this place, because I don’t particularly want to run into Candy. Get out of my way.
现在，孩子，\n我该离开这个地方了，\n因为我不想碰巧遇到糖儿。
You need to work on your active listening. I didn’t ask you a question.
你需要改善你的思维方式，\n而且我并不是在询问你。
I told you what you were going to do… and now you’re going to do it.
我只是告诉你，\n你现在需要这样做。
Ugh. Heroes!
呃...英雄？
Damn heroes... well, what’d I really expect.
去特么的英雄...\n好吧，我到底在期望什么？
Get up.
起来。
I’m not angry, just disappointed. But I will be taking my–
我没有生气，只是失望。\n但我会带走我的...
\PN! Tamarind!
\PN！塔玛琳！
Stop right there. I – I know I took, um, a little bit to get here, but that’s only because I was eavesdropping!
站住！我...我知道我来晚了，\n但那只是因为想听听你们说什么！
Candy, is it? Good to meet you in person... I suppose.
糖儿是吗？很高兴亲自见到你...\n大概吧。
You know where I stand. And I know where you do.
你知道我的立场，我也知道你的。
I’ve just settled things with \PN, so why don’t we have a chat in private? \PN, be a dear for me and leave us. I’d like to end this grudge here and now.
我刚刚解决了与\PN的谈话，\n所以为什么我们不私下聊聊呢？\n\PN，你先离开一下吧。\n我想在这里结束这场仇恨。
...Alright. This is between you and me, anyways. \PN, you can go, like, wait outside.
...这是我们之间的事情，\PN，你可以走了，在外面等一下。\n
Just for a minute. This’ll be quick.
只需要一分钟，很快...
Good. Glad we can see eye to eye on this.
很高兴我们在这个问题上\n能够达成一致。

Whoa. I remember... some WEIRD stuff!
哇，我想起了...\n一些奇怪的事情！
Did – Solgaleo and Lunala must’ve bolted. Can’t blame ‘em, hah! I guess I kinda did go a little light-crazy there.
索尔迦雷欧和露奈雅拉逃走了，\n不过不能怪他们，\n哈！我是不是过于痴迷光了。
Great question! I have no idea!
好问题！\n但我不知道！
Something horrible, probably! Fortunately, I’m naturally trauma-immune, so I’ve got that going for me!
或许是一些可怕的事情！\n但好在，我天生免疫创伤，\n这是我独有的优势！
Okie-dokie! There’s nothing that Lainie can’t spring back from! Even, uh... that.

没有人会相信你的话！\n即使他们相信了，\n他们就是马凯亚的警察！\n所以我什么都不用担心！
As far as I can tell, my mind was hijacked by an extradimensional intelligence of nebulous nature! I dunno!
在我的感知之中，\n我的思想似乎被一个\n模糊的超维度智能劫持了！\n更具体的就不清楚了！
Maybe avatars of Ultra Beasts work differently – I’m not a scientist! Unless you count my PhD in friendology.
也许超级异兽的化身不太一样....\n当然，我不是科学家！\n除非你把交朋友博士也算进去。
All I know is I came back to Makya with an amazing catch. Next thing I know I want to become friends with the moon and sun!
我知道的内容就是\n当时带着一大批收获回到马凯亚，\n然后就想跟太阳和月亮交朋友。
That’s not really out of character for me, though, so nobody noticed anything was wrong!
不过这对我来说\n并不是什么不寻常的事情，\n所以也没有人觉得有什么不对劲！
Let me put it in simple terms!
让我简单说一下吧！
Lainie go Alola. Lainie come back. Lainie feel weeeeird. Lainie accidentally summon manifestations of sun and moon. Oops!
兰妮去阿罗拉了，\n兰妮回来了，\n兰妮感觉很奇怪，\n兰妮不小心召唤出了\n太阳和月亮的化身，哎呀！
OK!
好的！
Aaapaaaarreeeentlyyy.
显 -------------- 然。
Neeecrooozmaaa.
奈 ------ 克洛 ------ 兹玛。
Caaan – OK, nevermind.
它能 ----- 好吧，算了。
Apparently Necrozma can call Solgaleo and Lunala from across the universe so it can feed off their eternal light!
显然，奈克洛兹玛\n可以从宇宙的任何地方召唤\n索尔迦雷欧和露奈雅拉，\n以便吸取它们永恒的光芒！
Cool! Also, sorry about that one!
很酷！我也对此感到抱歉！
Only legally, and only in Sinnoh! They couldn’t catch me to get me evaluated anywhere else!
只有在合法的情况下，\n而且只有在神奥地区！\n他们没办法在其他地方对我评估！
Speaking of catching things: that avatar of Necrozma can call Solgaleo and Lunala from anywhere!
但说到这个了：\n那个奈克洛兹玛的化身\n可以从任何地方召唤\n索尔迦雷欧和露奈雅拉！
And they just show up! To have their endless light, um, ended! Oopsie!
然后它们就出现了！\n为了让它们无尽的光芒，\n嗯...结束！诶呀！
I don’t really get how avatars work! Or how Ultra Beasts work! So I REALLY don’t understand what that Necrozma avatar was doing!
我真的不懂化身的原理！\n或者说超级异兽的存在原理！\n所以我也真的不知道，\n那个奈克洛兹玛化身在干什么！
But thanks for getting rid of it, by which I mean me!
但是感谢你把它...\n我是说我，给消灭了！
Next time just punch me in the face! It’ll probably work better! Oh, also, you should probably take this so there isn’t a next time!
下次直接打我脸吧！\n这样可能会更有效！\n哦，还有，你最好拿着这个，\n这样就不会有下次了！
She hands you a Beast Ball. There is a terrible presence within that threatens to devour all light within the room, and possibly the world.
她递给你一个究极球，\n里面有一股可怕的气息，\n吞噬着房间内的所有光亮，\n甚至还要吞噬整个世界。
It’s probably for the best that Lainie doesn’t have this.
最好还是不要让它\n继续待在兰妮身边了。
Cool! Have fun with that thing!
好吧！希望玩得开心！
Try not to let it fuse with sources of boundless energy and scour the land and sky with hellish light!
尽量不要让它\n与无尽能量的源头融合，\n用地狱般的光芒扫荡大地和天空！
OK! It’s PROBABLY gone for good anyways, so what’s the harm?
嗯，它可能已经永远消失了，\n所以没有什么害处？
If you change your mind about the mind-hijacking entity of darkness, just ask anytime!

Its an item that makes shiny Pokemon more likely to appear to you.
这是一种能让异色宝可梦\n更容易出现在面前的道具。
I'll part with it for 200 Battle Points.
只要200战斗积分就可以了。
Just don't ask where I got the charm or what I'm gonna do with the Battle Points.
别问我这护符从哪里来，\n也别问我这些积分会到哪里去。
I'm glad we could come to an understanding.
很高兴我们能达成交易。
Adiue, \PN.
再见了，\PN。
Shame. Well, the offer stands.

Well, the offer stands.

Hello to you, young one.
你好，年轻人。
I am Hekata. Known as a historian in some circles, and as a witch in others.
我是经方，\n某些人管我叫历史学家，\n也有很多人管我叫女巫。
Have you delved into the earth of Makya?
你有没有深入探索马凯亚的土地？
In the nearby mine I did, and discovered a wondrous secret in its depths: An ore holding ancient powers.
在附近的矿场深处，\n我发现了一个秘密：\n一块蕴含着古老力量的矿石。
By long study of yellowed scrolls in the archives of Sinnoh I finally came to understand its purpose, and my own along with it.
在研究过神奥地区的历史古迹后，\n我终于理解了其背后的含义，\n并得知了基本的运用方法。
That being: Transmuting Origin Ore into Pokemon thought long extinct in the land of Hisui.
将起源矿石之内的力量，\n转化到已经灭绝的洗翠宝可梦体内。
Speak to me again if you wish to see me perform my spell.
如果你需要我施展这种魔法，\n就来找我吧。
You need only provide me a chunk of Origin Ore, and I can prepare my spell right away.
你只需要提供一块起源矿石，\n我就能完成整个仪式。
Seeking your own destiny, I see. I understand.
我能理解，\n你也只是在追寻自己的命运。
I am glad that you answered my summons.
很高兴你响应了我的召唤。
I suppose now is the time for proper introductions.
我觉得是时候\n做个正式的自我介绍了。
By long study of yellowed scrolls in the archives of Sinnoh I came to understand Origin Ore, and my purpose along with it.
通过我长期研究神奥的古籍，\n我逐渐了解了起源矿石的一切，\n以及我接下来要做的事情。
After the more urgent matter is finished, return to me and I will gladly perform my spell for you.
等你把紧急事项都做完之后，\n再来这里找我吧，\n我很乐意为你施法。
Without further ado, let us begin discussing the topic I mentioned in our phone call.
话不多说，我们直接开始正题吧。
For some time now I have been keen to a gathering of magical energy within Mt. Kilna.
我...大概有一段时间了吧...\n一直关注着齐纳山的能量聚集现象。
I believe the earthquake that shook this region after your championship victory was linked to this.
我觉得你夺冠后的震颤，\n也跟这件事有一定关系。
However, before I could study the phenomenon in earnest, it dissipated almost entirely.
不过，我还没来得及，\n认真研究这一现象的本质，\n它就悄然消失了。
I've heard through my connections that you may have had something to do with that.
所以...我觉得既然可能跟你有关...
Although, details are scarce.
哪怕只有一丁点关联，
I ask you now. Would you let an old witch in on the secret?
我也希望你能将其告知于我。
Zounds! What a wondrous story.
这...真是个神奇的故事。
You've witnessed some very ancient magicks indeed.
你亲眼见证了古老的魔法。
...Regigigas, the demiurge, the lord golem of legend.
雷吉奇卡斯...传说中的宝可梦。
It is no surprise that the very earth would quake in its presence...
地球在它面前震颤，\n这一切都说得通了...
Allow me to ponder the situation.
请先允许我思考一下。
In my envisioning, primal energy yet lingers in the place you confronted Yezera.
在我的感知之中，\n原始的能量还萦绕在\n你和叶泽拉交战的地方。
If you should return to that spot, you should find some <imp>artifact</imp> of her ritual.
如果你回到那个地方，\n或许能找到一些\n她用来祭祀的<imp>工艺品</imp>。
To allow such an object to roam free in this world... t'would be an act of mighty hubris.
让这样一个存在在世界上驰骋...\n真是一种狂妄的行为。
I beseech you, delve once again <imp>underneath Mt. Kilna</imp>, and find it.
我恳求你，再次进入<imp>齐纳山地下</imp>，\n然后找到它！
Then, return to me so that I can examine it for you.
然后，带它来见我，\n我会帮你破解其中的秘密。
I suppose I will merely have to respect your choice in this matter.
不过，至于怎么选择，\n我会完全尊重你自己的意愿。
Secrets and I are well acquainted, after all.
毕竟，我和秘密很熟悉。
If the winds of change do blow upon your spirit in this matter, do speak to me again.
如果因为某件事，\n使变革之风再次吹向你，\n就再来找我吧。
Do you seek me for my spellcraft? Or is it time to satiate my curiosity on the matter of Mt. Kilna?
你是为了我的法术才来的？\n还是要满足我对齐纳山的好奇心？
Very well, let me turn my thoughts to Hisui.
好的，让我们先将目光放到洗翠。
Have you collected the remnant of Regigigas' magicks?
你找到雷吉奇卡斯的魔法残余了吗？
Delightful! My thanks upon you.
真是太好了，谢谢。
Hand it to me, posthaste.
快拿给我看看吧！
You hand the Primal Clay over to Dr. Hekata.
你将原始粘土交给了经方博士。
Yes! Exactly as expected. This is a most powerful catalyst for ancient magicks.
嗯，跟我预想中一样，\n这是古代魔法的强大催化剂。
The very legends of yore should be now at your fingertips.
昔日的传奇，\n现在就在你的股掌之间。
You will only need to find echoes of their power to which to attune it.
你只需要找到他们力量的回音，\n就可以调整它了。
That task I leave to you, as my body is not suited to the travel that will surely be required.
这个任务依旧要交给你了，\n因为我的身体状态不适合长途旅行。
Dr. Hekata hands back the Primal Clay.
经方博士将原始粘土还给你。
As for myself, I should still be able to make use of the Primal Clay's catalytic power.
至于我自己这边，\n我应该能利用原始粘土的催化能力。
Through my various implements, I can craft a mimicry of the essences of a few <imp>lesser Pokemon of legend</imp>.
通过我的各种工具，\n或许可以尝试模仿\n一些<imp>传说宝可梦的精髓之处</imp>。
What I shall need from you is more Origin Ore, of course.
当然，同时需要更多起源矿石。
I shall also need a living creature to study.
还要研究具体的每种生命。
With those requirements, one might even dub this process "cloning."
有了这些前提条件，\n就能达成人们所说的“克隆”了。
Hahaha, what a thought!
哈哈哈，真是个好主意！
Ahem, regardless...
咳咳，不管怎样...
It would be my honor to perform this grand new spell for you.
我很荣幸能为你施展这个咒语。
Please return to me when you have the neccessary components.
请你拿到必要的材料后再来找我吧。
You need only provide me a chunk of Origin Ore, and I can prepare either of my spells right away.
你只需要给我一块起源矿石，\n我就能为你施展一次法术。
Which of my spells would you like me to perform for you?
你想让我施展哪种法术？
No
不用了
Yes
来
Neither
都不用
Create a Hisuian Pokemon

Be wary - triumphant pride precipitates a dizzying fall...
要小心...过度的骄傲\n会让你跌入无尽的深渊...

哇，你真的很强大！\n不管你遇到什么训练家，\n都可以教教他们谁才是老大！
Hehe, you should go back! Someone meaner than me might find you.

These catacombs are ancient, but there is hardly any mention of them in written record beyond the fact that it exists.
这些地下墓穴如此古老，\n几乎没有任何书面记录提到它。

Huzzah! Another valiant knight hast arrived at the xenith of our quest!

Our merry friend hast did search for many a worthy trainer. However in this present time we may find that trainer before us!
虽然我们已经找到了\n很多值得尊敬的训练家，\n但是，现在面前这个才最重要。
Rennyo hast did talk about thy battle prowess for many a day and night!

But perhaps you are a Marshadow of your former self?
还是说你已经忘记了玛夏多的风采？
Nonsense! I'm sure this Trainer will show us a fighter most valiant!
胡说！我相信这位训练家\n会展现出最英勇的姿态！
Whether they win or not, however, is another matter...

Gentlemen! To arms!

没错，勇士们，冲啊！
Cowardice? Or strategy? It will be revealed to us which of the two is present here soon enough.
是懦弱还是策略？\n很快就将揭晓答案了。
It would seem that our combined might has been bested once again. What a show!
看来我们联合也没戏啊！
I should have surmised as much! All four of us felt your might as you approached.
我早该想到了，当你靠近时，\n我们四个人都感受到了你的力量。
It should come at no surprise that our new friend wishes to meet you.
我们的新朋友想要见见你，\n这应该不会让你感到太惊讶吧。

\PN. I hope you know I had to delay a meeting with the board to be here.
\PN，我觉得你得知道，\n我是推迟了董事会才能过来的。
Fortunately I have the sway to simply tell people when and where I’ll hold my meetings. I am never late, et cetera.
好在我有权力更改会议时间，\n这样我就永远不会迟到。
You’ve certainly proven yourself. Did you ever get around to demolishing Tamarind?
等下，你现在的确成了冠军，\n那你找到毫无保留地\n痛扁塔玛琳一顿的机会了吗？
I’ll have to ask her about it... perhaps open up some old wounds.
看来得找个机会问问她...\n看会不会让她破防。
Hmph.
哼哼...
Regardless, you’ve saved our operations in this region.
无论如何，你现在都是这里的英雄。
As well as this region.

Thank you.

I plan to inquire with you in the future as how best to handle LuxTech and Mavis... but that’s business. Enjoy the ceremony.
我本来打算问问你，\n如何处理光华和梅维斯的关系...\n但那是公事，回头再聊吧。
Eifion’s Manaphy undulates with excitement upon seeing you. It seems to be more confident than when you saw it last, too.
艾维恩的玛纳霏一看到你，\n就兴奋地跳了起来，\n它看起来也比上次见时更自信了。
Perhaps it’s readying itself for a rematch...?
或许，它在等待下一次对决？
...An empty seat.
...一个空座位。
Nothing to note here, except for a faint scent. Smells like... clear water, and white flowers...
除了淡淡的香味，\n没什么值得注意的...\n闻起来像清水，和淡淡的白花...
Hey. Didn’t expect to see me, right?
没想到会见到我，对吧？
I didn’t expect to be here, honestly. Got the invite from Tamarind and nearly threw it in the trash.
说实话我也没想到自己会来，\n接到塔玛琳的邀请后，\n我差点顺手就扔进了垃圾桶里。
But I figured, ah, why not? So, uh, I’m here.
但是...呃...转念一想，\n我...呃...为啥不来呢？
Good job becoming Champion. I guess?
总之，能成为冠军代表你干得不错。
Gonna be honest: I don’t really know you. But I guess you’re cool, so… yeah, congrats.
其实我并不怎么了解你，\n但看起来挺不错的，\n所以...还是得恭喜你。
Freeing me from being a gym leader is worth a thousand times more to me than this whole mess.
对我来说，把我从道馆馆主\n这个烂摊子上解放出来，\n才是最重要的事。
Yo! Great to see you again! Man, it feels like it’s been forever.
哟，很高兴见到你，老兄，\n感觉很久没见过了啊。
Gonna be honest: it’s really damn hard sitting here. Just, like, it was supposed to be me, y’know?
说实话，我感觉坐在这里很难受，\n就好像...大概...本该属于我？
But don’t get me wrong: you earned this. You gave 110 percent.
不要误会，这是你应得的，\n毕竟你付出了110%的努力。
Maybe more like 150, honestly. Glad I got to see it.
还是说150%？
Hello, nondescript friend!
你好，不起眼的朋友！
I am studiously not remembering any prior interaction we may or may not have had!
我刻意没有去回忆，\n我们之前是不是有过互动！
I am present at this location to support you in whatever endeavor you are here to undertake!
无论你在做什么，\n我都会在这里支持你！
I do this because you are my friend and Lainie does not let her friends down!
我这样做因为你是我的朋友，\n而兰妮不会让她的朋友失望！
Even if sometimes she really wishes she could just forget about them and the incredibly awkward things they witnessed...
即便她真的希望能忘掉他们，\n忘掉一些亲眼目睹的，\n令人难以置信的尴尬往事...
It would be totally disrespectful to leave now, while everyone is waiting for you!
现在大家都在等你，\n你就这么走了是不是不太尊重？
You done lollygagging? We can get started whenever you want.
玩够了吗？可以开始了吗？
You want me to count the number of seconds we’ve got this room for?
你想让我数数\n在这个房间里待了多少秒吗？
Because I can. I’ve got a timer set.

Fine, go. Make it quick, though.

Alright…
现在…
With the shockingly broad powers invested in me as Makya’s regional Professor, I hereby –
作为马凯亚地区的博士，\n我在此以我的权力...
Is this the part where I say “I object?”
我能说“我反对”吗？
\PN. You’re looking better.
\PN，你看起来气色不错。
Helluva lot better than last time I saw you, to be honest. This place suits you.
说实话比上次见面时好多了，\n或许是这地方很适合你？
So does not burning the Litwick at both ends.
起码比烛光灵好一些。
Damn straight!
对！我就说了！
Sorry I’m late – my companion here apparently has some outstanding warrants and I needed to grease a few palms.
首先，我迟到了，\n因为我的同伴还有几张逮捕令，\n我得去打点一下。
You know how it is.
你知道是怎么回事。
That’s me! But, seriously, c’mon.
真是...他奶奶滴...
You got the title of Champion the second you beat me. You want her to tell you it, or me?
你打败我后拿到冠军头衔，\n难道还需要我告诉妈妈？
Hahaha!
哈哈哈！
Hey, kiddo. Are you actually glad to see me?
嘿，小鬼，见到我高兴不？
I can’t even remember the last time that happened.
我都不记得上次\n这么高兴是什么时候了
Oh, but I’m forgetting: this is Zoé.
哦，我忘了：这是佐伊。
You two’ve met, I know.
我知道你们认识。
After I left, I ran into her. One thing led to another, and now we’re a thing. Sorry to break your heart if you were hoping for an edgy industrial goth GF.
竞技大会结束后，我遇到了她，\n然后一来二去，我们就成了。\n如果你也想找一个前卫的哥特女友，\n很抱歉伤了你的心咯。
*hiss* The mask’s practical, idiot! And I’m not edgy!
*哼*戴面具是为了实用，\n而且我也不搞什么哥特式！
Ugh. If you want edge, I’ll show you edge. Wait till you see me dressed to the nines.
哼，我什么时候打扮一下，\n绝对亮瞎你们的狗眼。
He wishes.
想屁吃！
...Ugh. Sorry, that’s reflexive. Yes, we’re dating.
...呃...抱歉，条件反射...\n没错，我们在约会。
*hiss* Leave Mavis out of this.
*哼*跟她没关系。
I haven’t even met her and I already hate her guts.
虽然没见过她，\n但我对她没什么好印象。
You talking to me or him? 'Cause we both disappeared for a few months. It’s a long story.
你在跟我还是他说话？\n至于我们消失的这段时间...
Oh, no, keep going, you three.
我...随便，你们继续吧。
I really want to hear more about which of you is dating the gym leader I forgot existed. We’ve got all day.
我也很想知道你怎么\n追上一个道馆馆主的，\n我们有一整天的时间听八卦。
Actually, you know what, that’s a good point. Fine, Zain, you were the runner-up.
不过，再怎么说，\n赞恩也是今年的亚军。
You do the ceremony! I finally get to delegate! Now I know what it feels like to be Helena!
那你来主持仪式！\n海伦娜，我明白你的感受了！
You three gremlins get this figured out. I’m done! I’m out!
你们三个自己来主持，\n老娘不玩了！
OK, I think it goes something like this.
好嘞，我觉得吧，应该...
With the – what’d she say? – shockingly broad powers invested in me? As, what, your jackass older brother?
她刚才...呃...说的啥来着？\n我，作为你的混蛋哥哥，
With said powers, I hereby bestow upon you, \PN, the title of Champion.
\PN，在此授予你冠军称号。
Y’know, for being a spoiled rich brat and a golden child, you’re actually pretty cool. You want a hug?
要知道，一个被宠坏的富二代，\n能做到这一步，真的很酷！\n要来一个拥抱吗？
Aww, kid. Damn...
你这小子...该死...
*hiss* Sorry. You two are too cute not to join.
*噗嗤*抱歉，\n你俩太有意思了。
\PN, I promise we’re gonna take care of you from now on whether you like it or not, OK?
\PN，这样吧，\n不管你乐不乐意，\n以后我们都会照顾你，怎么样？
Zain and I have been talking about you and Mavis and everything and... yeah. We’re gonna adopt you if we have to.
赞恩一直跟我谈论你和你母亲，\n还有之前的其他事情...\n如果有必要，我们会收养你。
Well, that’s moving a little fast... but, yeah. What she means to say is that I want to make things up to you.
不是...这有点过了...\n不过，也差不多，\n反正会补偿你就是了。
And that means being there for you.
也就代表，会陪在你身边。
So, y’know, if things don’t work out with Mavis and you need someone... we’re your family. If you’ll have us.
如果你跟妈妈那边不顺利，\n如果你还需要的话，\n我们也依然是你的家人。
Hah!
哈哈！
Don’t worry, I get it. I deserve that.
啊，我知道，这才对。
But, uh, listen, kid: if you need me, I’m here. Same goes for Zoé.
不过，小鬼：\n如果你什么时候需要帮忙了，\n我和佐伊都会出现。
If things don’t work out with Mavis, we’ll be your family. If you’ll have us.
如果你跟妈妈那边不顺利，\n如果你还需要的话，\n我们也依然是你的家人。
You never gotta be alone. Alright?
你不会因此而孤独的。
Of course. You’re welcome, kiddo. Champion. \PN. Whatever you’re called now.
当然，不客气，小鬼。\n还是说冠军？\PN？\n不管你现在喜欢哪个称呼。
I can’t promise much, but I’ll be there for you. Things are gonna be different now.
我没办法做出太多承诺，\n但最起码的陪伴，\n还是没问题的。
Love you too. Can’t believe I didn’t for a little while there.
我也爱你。\n可能在某个时间点不爱你。
But, hey, we can’t change the past, right? Only the future. Things are gonna be different now.
不过，我们没办法改变过去，\n但未来可以，一切都会不同。
I know you will. You’re tough, and you’re smart.
或许吧，你很坚强，也很聪明。
But if you ever aren’t fine, I’m here for you. We are.
但是你也会遇到一些问题，\n总之，我们都会陪着你。
Things are gonna be different now.
现在已经不同于往日了。
Hey! \PN! Great work!
嘿！\PN！干的不错！
I am absolutely STOKED that you got an actual ceremony. I sent Tamarind five letters telling her how disappointed I was that the whole thing got ruined!
很高兴这个仪式能够顺利举行，\n我之前给塔玛琳寄了五封信，\n告诉她我对仪式被毁有多么失望！
I, uh, also tried to see if Zoé would show up, but she’s still gone. Starting to get worried about her.
我...呃...不知道佐伊会不会出现，\n她已经消失很长一段时间了，\n我有点担心她的情况。
But that’s a me problem! You just relax!
但这是我自己的问题，\n你只需要休息和放松就可以了！
Hello, \PN.
你好，\PN。 
The importance of the Champion title is lost on me, but I received an invitation, and had no intention of refusing it.
我不知道冠军的头衔有多重要，\n但我受到了这份邀请，\n并且不打算拒绝。
Consider this minor show of moral support repayment for your assistance. Congratulations.
就当这是对您的帮助，\n给予的小小回报吧，祝贺你。
Hey! Lookin’ pretty good. Sorry this took so long to get set up.
嘿，看起来不错嘛，\n抱歉花了这么久才弄好。
We were supposed to get you officially coronated as Champion right after the tournament, but then there was The Incident.
我们本来该在竞技大会结束后，\n就让你加冕为冠军的，\n只是没想到发生了那种事。
And since it takes eight billion years to get anything through bureaucracy limbo here, it’s... how late is this?
然后还要花80亿年\n通过上面的官僚弄好文件，\n所以...到底晚了多久？
Three months? Two and a half?
三个月？还是两个半月？
Oh, and we only have thirty minutes, so let’s keep it moving.
算了，我们只有三十分钟时间，\n大家还是快点吧。
Thanks. Can’t help but notice you didn’t say I was lookin’ good... but that’s fair, I guess.
谢谢，但我注意到你\n并没说“我看起来很棒”...\n那就对了，你不需要撩我。
For one, I’m like twenty-five years older than you. And, uh, for two I’ve got some grey coming in.
首先，我大了你二十五岁，\n其次，我头发都白了。
Never let it be said I aged with grace.
虽然我不希望有人说我老了。
But who’s counting? You want me to tell you I’m sorry? You know me well enough to know I’m not gonna.
是谁一天天在数？\n你想让我给你道歉吗？\n你知道我不可能这么做。
I’ve had enough on my plate without trying to set up your little victory lap.
我的事情已经够多了，\n别再用我给你的胜利铺路了。
You’re very welcome.
不客气。
At least someone appreciates the monumental effort I put into this damn region.
至少有人能欣赏到，\n我对这个该死的地区，\n付出了多大的努力。
You know how hard it is to get even a single person in a room for half an hour in Makya?
你知道在马凯亚，\n想安静地在房间里\n待半个小时有多难吗？
Everyone’s always scheming or brooding or committing sins.
每个人都心怀鬼胎，\n不知道打着什么算盘。
But like I said, we’re on a timer, so let’s get moving.
但是，我们时间不多，\n所以赶快行动起来。
I know certain individuals who will remain unnamed will have their eyes on their watches the entire time.
我知道某些不愿透露姓名的人，\n会一直盯着手表看。
Honestly I can’t believe the stars aligned to get everyone I needed in one place for this long. Minor miracle.
说实话，我有点难以相信，\n在这么短的时间内，\n让所有人都待在这同一个地方。
Anyways! Let’s go, let’s go!
不管怎么说，开始吧！
Howdy. Hope you ain’t feelin’ stood up.
诶嘿，希望你不会觉得被放鸽子了。
I plan on buyin' you a drink, never you worry. Just ain't been feelin' it with Yez gone.
我本来打算请你一起喝一杯，\n但是...也没什么，\n就是叶泽拉不在，没什么心情。
Part of my mind just ain’t in the here and now. Figured I’d show up for this, at least. I’ve been thinkin’ 'bout you more than I’d like to admit. Hah!
我最近一直有些心不在焉，\n所以我觉得应该来这里放松一下，\n我猜你肯定在更深层地\n揣测我的想法？哈哈！
Don’tcha go givin’ me that look. Go on. Git. We’ll have time enough for chit-chat later.
别用那种眼神看着我，\n这是你的典礼，\n之后我们还有很多时间可以闲聊。
Hah. Damn kid...

保险行业就是要预测未来。
Too bad I'm completely unpredictable!
可惜我没有这种天赋！
Well, I definitely didn't predict that.
我完全没有料到会这样。
Excuse me, I've got to update my mathematical models...
抱歉，我得更新我的数学模型了...
No matter. Even a loss is just more data to feed to the algorithm.
没关系，即便是输了，\n也为算法提供了更多的数据。
Dialogue here.

I'm just here for business, kid.
我只是来谈生意的，孩子。
Doing a run for a few friends.
替我朋友跑一圈而已。
This place's got some sick stuff.
这地方的东西真不错。
Sometimes, the hacker lady gives me rips of old games.
有时，会有黑客姐姐\n给我一些老游戏的翻版。
The publisher isn't gonna like that, heh.
出版商要难受咯，嘿嘿！
No
不要
Yes

An old, beaten up laptop. A couple dozen windows are open all at once.
一台破旧的笔记本电脑，\n同时有几十个窗口被打开了。
Something is being researched, but it's impossible to tell what specifically.
有些还在研究中的内容，\n但看不懂具体是什么。
It's Nora's laptop. She must have forgotten it in her hurry to get to Svait.
这是诺拉的笔记本电脑，\n她肯定是急着去霜皑镇，\n忘了带上它。
A map displayed on the screen shows a path to the west of the Ranger Station there.
屏幕上显示的地图上，\n有一条从霜皑镇往西走的小路。
“Over 2500 years ago, there existed a sect of itinerant priests who worshipped a Legendary Carver of Clay.
“2500年前，\n有一个巡回祭祀教派，\n一直崇拜着传说中的粘土雕刻师。
And by its hand, people were able to claim dominion over inhospitable lands high and low.
在它的帮助下，\n人们才得以在高低崎岖的\n荒凉土地上繁衍生息。
Yet, despite their efforts, humanity was cast out from the lands where the primal forces of this world worked.
尽管他们付出了许多努力，\n但人类终究还是被世界上\n最为原始的力量赶出了那里。
Back to the caves; which their species used to call home. Now the caverns would be their tombs…"
洞穴，那是它们曾经的家园，\n洞穴，那将成为它们的坟墓…"
Guess I forgot to keep the door locked… but I can’t really turn away the esteemed Champion \PN, now can I?
哦？看来我忘了锁门了…\n不过我也不能拒绝尊贵的冠军，\n\PN，对吧？
I don’t know why you’re here but, if I had to make a guess… you’re searching for something; like I am.
我不知道你为什么来这里，\n但根据我的猜测...\n你应该像我一样，在找什么吧？
Name’s Nora. I like to think of myself as a seeker of knowledge.
我是诺拉，我一般喜欢\n将自己称为“知识的探求者”。
I took up a job as a janitor here to gain access to this library, since it’s sealed off to the public.
为了能进入这座图书馆，\n我特意应聘了这里的管理员，\n毕竟这儿并不对外开放。
It’s not trespassing if they’re paying you to be here.
现在我有正经理由待在这里，\n就不能算是非法入侵了。
Team Chasm apparently had roots in anthropology, based on all the records they’ve shoved away here.
从他们藏在这里的记录来看，\n裂隙队显然也是\n从人类学开始一点点入手的。
Translated passages with way too many sticky notes go over all kinds of myths and legends.
这些经过翻译的文献上，\n大大小小的全是便签，\n其中涉及到各种神话传说。
One that caught my eye involves the Seekers, those ancient priests I mentioned earlier.
我最在意的还是那些探索者...\n当然也可以管他们叫古代祭司。
They were ultimately destroyed by a great darkness that some protector deity was apparently equipped to handle.
他们最终被庞大的黑暗能量毁灭，\n而他们所信仰的守护神，\n显然没有应对这种黑暗的方法。
But, based on the fact that the Seekers disappeared, the guardian must have failed in its duty.
那些探索者就此销声匿迹，\n而这位失职的守护神也不见了踪影。
Why? I don’t know.
至于具体的原因，我不知道。
The notes here make reference to materials that I can’t find anywhere in this room.
这里的注释当中提到了\n这个图书馆没有收录的材料。
I’m thinking that these records have to exist elsewhere.
或许这些记录存在于其他什么地方。
And I’m going to assume that they must have been saved digitally, as there’s nowhere else in the region with this much literature.
考虑到裂隙队，这些文献有可能\n是以数字形式保存下来的，\n不然我想不到它还会在哪儿。
Do you think you can search LuxTech for any servers hosting data from before Team Chasm was established?
你能在光华市的档案中，\n搜索到一些裂隙队解散之前，\n所存放的数据或者服务器地址吗？
I’ll keep on searching here in the meantime for something hidden in the stacks.
当然，我也会试着在这里，\n找找有没有其他相关的内容。
Let me know if you find something over at LuxTech.
如果你在光华市找到些什么的话，\n就来告诉我吧。
I’ve only been finding fun facts, the kind you’d see on a moving truck.
我这里只看到一些趣闻，\n类似在搬家卡车上那种小故事。
Did you know that hexagons were an important symbols of the Seekers?
据说那些探索者的标志，\n是一种六边形。
That’s apparently what inspired Team Chasm’s logo.
恐怕这也是裂隙队标志的来源。
You’re back! Excellent.
你回来了！太好了！
I managed to make a breakthrough while you were away.
在你去那边搜集材料时，\n我这里也取得了突破。
Would you mind showing me what you’ve found first?
能先给我看看你找到了什么吗？
You hand over the Old USB Drive.
你将旧U盘交给她。
Nora loads the device on her laptop.
诺拉将其链接在笔记本上了。
Fascinating.
太惊人了。
This one file, Project Chrysopoeia Albedo, goes into great detail of a large volcanic eruption thousands of years ago which heavily impacted the region.
这份名为“莹润金成计划”的文件里，\n详细描述了数千年前的一次\n规模浩大的火山爆发，\n以及其对该地区造成的严重影响。
It makes sense that the large clouds of ash would be devastating to a civilization in its technological infancy.
大量的火山灰对于正处于\n技术萌芽阶段的文明造成了\n毁灭性的打击。
This must be the "great darkness" that the Seekers mentioned.
这一定就是“庞大的黑暗”。
Perhaps that’s also why they built what would become the underground ruins; like those found in Mt. Kilna?
或许这就是他们\n建造地下城市的原因？\n就像齐纳山发现的那些。
Maybe those places were meant to be safe spaces from the smog?
或许这些地方本就是\n躲避火山灰影响的安全地带？
Wait, no. Why would they have built shelters if they had the guardian?
等等，不对劲！\n他们不是还有守护者吗？
Hahaha. This is the rush I’ve been seeking.
哈哈哈，这就是我所追寻的！
Questions whose answers are more questions.
问题接着答案，\n答案又会催生出新的问题。
As for my own findings: I found references to an aboveground ruins site which might lead to what we’re after.
对了，还有我这边的发现：\n我找到一个地面废墟的参考资料，\n那里或许有我们要找的东西。
I’ll be waiting for you in <imp>Svait, on the upper level</imp>.
我会到 <imp>霜皑镇上层</imp>，\n海拔稍微高点的地方等你。
[Map428]
Wow! It's a Volcanion, trapped inside a large boulder!
哇，是一只被困在\n石头里面的波尔凯尼恩！
Hey, \PN! Come around to the front.
嘿，\PN！来这边！
It’s still so striking to me that at any time, Team Chasm could’ve added this protector of the region to its arsenal.
按照裂隙队的行事风格，\n他们总会把所有能利用的\n力量都变成自己的武器，\n可是...
Sure, they managed to capture Heatran, the Titans, and other oddities I still need to comb that USB about.
就像席多蓝恩和巨人们那样，\n我还得继续梳理一下U盘里的内容。
But were they so dominated by Yezera that they thought Volcanion wouldn’t make a difference?
还是说因为叶泽拉的控制，\n才导致他们对波尔凯尼恩\n的态度发生了变化？
It makes me realize how terrifying going against a single person with overwhelming power can be.
这让我意识到，\n与一个拥有压倒性力量的人为敌\n是多么可怕的事情。
...as you showed me, \PN.
就像你对我来说，\PN。
Anyway, ready?
总之，准备好了吗？
Nora brings out a small MP3 player, and presses a button.
诺拉拿出了一个小型MP3，\n并按下了其中一个按钮。
A soothing recording of an ancient flute fills the air.
舒缓悠扬的古笛声响起。
Ah. Seems like we have unwanted guests at this once private concert.
啊，看来有不速之客\n闯进我们的私人音乐会了。
Awesome. At least they look in the mood to dance.
也不错，至少它们看起来，\n也有共舞一曲的心情。
I guess we can crack some heads open, show them a genuine mosh pit experience.
不过我们还是把它们的脑袋敲开，\n展示一下什么叫“大场面”吧。
What do you think, \PN?
你觉得呢，\PN？
Ah. I realize now that, while I patched your team up after our battle, I’m out of supplies to heal my own.
啊，有点糟糕，我之前在战斗后\n为你的宝可梦恢复状态，\n结果导致我自身的药品不够了。
I’ll be counting on you!
看来只能指望你了！
What a painful cry…
这哭声…痛彻心扉。
I can’t imagine how it must feel to wake up thousands of years after the disappearance of the people you were meant to protect.
我永远无法想象，\n这种在本应保护的人\n离开数千年后才醒来的痛苦。
I realize now that I’ve only thought about how others would USE Volcanion.
我现在才意识到自己之前\n只顾考虑别人如何\n利用波尔凯尼恩了。
As a tool, a reward, or something in that vein…
将其作为工具、武器、奖励...
I haven't been seeing this creature as a living being.
它是一个活生生的个体。
I saw it as words on a page.
我却把它看作是一页文字。
Volcanion seems to be looking to you for guidance.
波尔凯尼恩似乎在等待你的指示。
Take Volcanion with you?
要带走波尔凯尼恩吗？
Nora, seeing your intent, comes over and hands you a PokeBall.
诺拉看着你将其收入宝可梦球。
The Volcanion seems to sigh in relief as it enters the ball.
波尔凯尼恩似乎在\n进入宝可梦球的一瞬间松了一口气。
Wonderful.
太好了。
Well, I guess this is where we go our separate ways, \PN.
好吧，也到我们\n说再见的时候了，\PN。
I hope you don’t mind, but I’m going to keep the USB you gave me.
但我会留下这个U盘，\n希望你不要介意。
Turning away from it all now would be to live a life knowing what passion is, but never permitting myself to experience it.
现在就这样放手，\n也就代表着放弃了就在眼前的，\n去体会激情岁月的机会。
There are other loose ends left behind by Team Chasm, the Seekers, and who knows what else that I want to see through.
我还想试着去发现更多\n裂隙队之前留下的痕迹。
Toodles.
回见。
Volcanion nods. It will wait for you.
波尔凯尼恩点了点头，\n它会在这里等你的。
I still think it’d be for the best if you took Volcanion with you.
我觉得你还是带走波尔凯尼恩吧。
I’ve spent so much time looking towards the past for answers.
花了这么长时间寻找答案...
Though, I guess I can keep them company for the time being…
起码我可以陪陪他们了。
The snow here seems to be heating up directly into steam.
这里的雪似乎被直接加热成了蒸汽。
Is this what Svait looked like before Team Chasm did what it did…?
这就是裂隙队之前\n在霜皑镇所做的事情吗？
The sublimation seems to be a different effect from the subthermal vents in the Svait Sauna.
这里跟霜皑镇桑拿室不同，\n这里的“水”并未经历过液态。
But maybe… The sources of those phenomena are the same?
但...或许源头是一致的？
Yes
带走
No
算了

我的工作是保持这里的卫生，\n但我同时也是探险爱好者。
I've been exploring Makya's for years. My dream is to take a trip to see some of tunnels under Kalos.

I caught a few extra Pokemon on my last vacation to Hoenn.
上次去丰缘度假的时候，\n我多抓了好几只宝可梦。
I don't really need 'em, but I REALLY need coffee right now.
但我不是很需要它们，\n我现在最需要的是一倍咖啡。
I'll trade you one for a cup. I got a Corsola and a Shuckle up for grabs.
我可以用一只太阳珊瑚或者壶壶，\n跟你换一杯咖啡。
Dang. Really pegged you as the type to carry around arbitrary cups of coffee.
也对，你怎么也不像\n会随身携带咖啡的人。
Oh yeah. That hits the spot.
好耶，直达病根！
Aite, a deal is a deal. Which 'mon are you feeling?
说到做到，你想要哪一只？
Alright. I'll be here.
好的，我平时都在这里。
All yours.
这是你的了。
Now to get through the rest of my day...
现在...我得把先完成今天的工作。
No cups? Hmm.
没有？呃...
These barrels aren't going to inspect themselves...
这些货物就不能检查好自己吗... 
This plant has been running since Prizca was still mostly brick and wood.
在宏礼市还是以木屋为主的时候，\n这家工厂就开始运作了。
A bit interesting that there was a huge uptick in fires when Team Chasm took it over.
不过有意思的是，\n在裂隙队接手后，\n这里的生产订单瞬间飙升。
Ah well, I'm paid to think it's a coincidence.
其实我觉得这是巧合啦！
I don't even really work. I just watch the Pokemon do it.
我甚至不需要做什么，\n只要盯着宝可梦们就行。
Sometimes I go out and grab them lunch. It's boring, but the benefits are surprisingly good.
除了偶尔出去给它们买午餐...\n虽然无聊，但乐得清闲。
Geodude is managing the supply chain! Impressive!
小拳石正在管理供应链！
Shh, don't report me. This is the most hidden place in the city. No one ever finds me here.
嘘，别举报我！\n这是城里最隐蔽的地方了，\n这样他们就找不到我！
Plus, I can torrent whatever I want on the WiFi here.
而且还能用这里的WiFi\n随便下载自己喜欢的内容。
Don't give coffee.
不给
Give coffee.

I'll choose later.

I'll take the Corsola.

There seem to be rocks in here. Does he feed this to his Pokemon?
这里好像有石头，\n他是在拿这个喂他的宝可梦？
Bence almost has a week of prepared meals in the fridge.
本斯冰箱里准备了这一周的饭菜。
One day is missing. An empty wrapper seems to have had a "Z" scribbled onto it.
有一天的伙食不见了，\n空包装上写着一个大大的“Z”。
Pieces of hair are at the edges of the sink. This must be where Bence trims that beard of his.
水槽边有一些掉落的碎毛发，\n应该是本斯刮下来的胡子。

It seems like they lost a lot of Pokemon battles back then...
那时，他们负多胜少...
[Map443]
Man, that battle really tuckered me out.
我去，这一仗给我累的...
I'm not a stranger to hard work, mind you.

A dusty, ancient computer terminal.

A dusty, old logbook. "Archive Catalogue" is written on the front in black marker.
一本满是灰尘的旧日志，\n上面有黑色记号笔写的“档案目录”。
As you approach, you overhear the men talking back and forth, complaining about the cold and the difficulty of their task.
当你走近时，\n无意中听到了有说话的声音，\n好像在抱怨\n这里的寒冷和任务的艰巨。
Apparently these are Kurt and Pearce, LuxTech employees.
显然是光华的员工库特和皮尔斯。
Jeez, this stuff really is ancient.
诶呀，真是个老古董。
Whose idea was it to let Tamarind name the Projects and Operation files for internal use?
让塔玛琳来给内部文件命名的\n馊主意到底是谁想出来的？
Her naming conventions require a thesaurus to decipher.
她用的那些词词典上都不好找！
She always was kind of a slob. Lambert was always cleaning up her messes.
而且她总是邋里邋遢的，\n需要兰伯特帮她收拾残局。
Speaking of, I do wonder how the chop off the old block is doing these days.
既然说到他了，\n也不知道那老小子最近怎么样。
Yeah, we should reach out to him sometime. Rafael too.
是啊，我们应该找机会跟他谈谈，\n还有拉斐尔。
We’ve both accrued too much PTO, after all. Haha.
毕竟我们积累的压力都多过头了，\n哈哈哈！
…Don’t you think it’s kinda odd that those two ended up as Gym Leaders?
你不觉得让他们两个\n当道馆馆主这件事很诡异吗？
I mean, Lambert, I kinda understand. But Rafael was primarily a scientist.
我...呃...兰伯特还能理解，\n但拉斐尔以前就是个研究员。
And that’s not even mentioning Noel. Who is. Noel.
哦对，还有诺埃尔...\n怎么想都别扭。
And we’re… here.
再就是...我们...在这儿...
And it seems we’re not the only ones here. You got something to say, or…?
看来这里不只有我们两个啊，\n你是有话要说…还是...
What? No!
什么？不可能！
This is a sensitive piece of machinery!
这台设备非常的珍贵！
There was a whole scrum ceremony covering this.
之前整个会议都在谈论这件事。
We can’t just give it away!
我们不可能拱手让人！
Forget the ceremony, Josh. It’s Mavis’ kid.
别管那什么会议了，\n这家伙是梅维斯的孩子。
So? Helena has been on our behinds for a while and we’ve already pushed this back again and again.
所以呢？海伦娜盯上我们多久了？\n我们已经不能再推了！
If we don’t do this now, she’ll have someone else do it.
就算我们不做，\n她也会派别人来的。
And I guess that makes you our "someone else."
然后我们就该 "收拾行李滚蛋"了。
If there’s something you want in this life, you have to take it.
如果你还有想要得到的东西，\n那就必须留下这个！
Using your own overwhelming strength.
用自己压倒性的力量。
So, you want us to hand the archive data over to you, huh?
所以，你想让我们\n把档案交给你，对吧？
If there’s something you want in this life, you have to take it. Using your own overwhelming strength.
如果你还有想要得到的东西，\n那就必须留下这个！\n用自己压倒性的力量。
My body’s shaking. I… How did you…?
我...我怎么...你...竟然...
I guess it really shows that you aren’t just Mavis’ kid anymore.
看来你已经不再只是\n“梅维斯的孩子”这么简单了。
You’re a champion. Through and through.
你配得上冠军的头衔。
I’m just glad Team Chasm’s gone.
我只是很高兴裂隙队不存在了。
Imagine if we somehow managed to win back then?
试想一下，如果当年我们赢了，\n那现在又会是什么样子呢？
You’d come around years later and tear what we built down. That’s horrifying.
但真的到了多年后，\n要将自己曾经建造的东西拆掉时，\n还是会感到很可怕。
Losing a fight like that reminds you of the good old days, dont’cha think, Kurt?
库特，输掉这场对决，\n会让你想起以前的美好时光吗？
You mean having to trudge through the lava filled chambers of an active volcano?
你是说在充满岩浆的\n火山洞穴中跋涉的日子吗？
Yeah, no. I’ll take my cushy office job with air conditioning any day.
哈，我才不觉得那美好，\n还是让我坐在办公室里吹空调吧。
But, a win’s a win, so here ya go…
总之输了就是输了，给你…
This thing is filled with early Chasm data.
这里面是裂隙队早期的数据。
When you get the chance, take a look at "Project Chrysopoeia Albedo".
如果你感兴趣的话，\n可以看看"莹润金成计划"。
I remember that one causing the eggheads a lot of pain.
我记得那次大家都吃了不少苦头。
The ritual to capture the target required a flute that was excavated much later on, in a place no one would ever think to find it.
我们当时需要一支特殊的笛子，\n来完成捕捉目标的仪式，\n后来是在一个完全想不到的地方，\n挖到这个宝贝的。
By that time, there wasn’t a pressing need for that whole song and dance.
但那个时候已经不需要它了，\n也不再需要那个仪式。
Not with something like Yezera keeping us on our toes.
它并不像叶泽拉那样，\n让我们不得不时刻绷紧神经。
You really gave it your all in that battle.
可以说是拼尽全力了。
It made me realize that I haven’t been giving mine here.
如果只是如此我还没有\n在这里献爱心的必要性。
Think I’m going to give my two weeks’ notice to Helena. Try my hand at being a Pro Trainer.
我想试着提前预约海伦娜的挑战，\n试试当职业训练家的感觉。
Can you give me that?
能把这个给我吗？
No.

You can have a maximum of 6 Pokémon with you at any time. This is known as your 'Team'. You can store extra Pokémon using the PC in any PokéCenter.
队伍最多拥有6只 宝可梦，其他宝可 梦则储存在宝可梦 中心的电脑中
Levels
等级
Each Pokémon has a level from 1 to 70. A Pokémon's level determines its stats as well as what moves it could learn. Reaching high enough levels also unlocks Evolution.
宝可梦的等级从1 到10不等，等级 决定了它可以学习 的招式和能否进化
Types are strong or weak against other types. Having a variety of different types on your team helps you take advantage of these relationships.

治疗宝可梦
Heal your Pokémon at PokéCenters between battles. You can often use the Aid Kit instead to save on traveling time.
在战斗间隙可以去 宝可梦中心治疗宝 可梦，也可以在路 上使用急救包来节 省时间
Who goes first?
先后手
In battle, the Pokémon with the higher speed stat gets to use their move first. Some moves modify this. Speed ties are decided randomly.
战斗中，速度属性 更高的宝可梦可以 率先行动，但有些 招式可以改变顺序 ，速度相等时随机 决定先后
Attacking vs Status
攻击与变化
Attacking moves deal damage. Status moves do not. Status moves are notated by a Yin/Yang symbol (White and Black intermixing).
攻击类招式会造成 伤害，但变化类招 式不会，通常带有 强化或削弱效果
Physical vs Special
物理和特殊
Attacking moves are split into Physical moves, and Special moves. Each of these categories uses different stats to determine how much damage is dealt to the target.
攻击招式分为物理 特殊两类，每种都 会以不同属性，决 定对目标造成的伤 害程度
Physical Moves
物理招式
Physical moves are notated by the symbol of a smashing fist. Their damage is based on the Attack (Atk) stat of the attacker and the Defense (Def) stat of the target.
物理伤害以爆炸符 号表示，其伤害基 于攻击者的攻击力 和承受者的防御力 进行计算
Special Moves
特殊招式
Special moves are notated by the symbol of a splash. Their damage is based on the Special Attack (Sp. Atk) of the attacker and the Special Defense (Sp. Def) of the target.
物理伤害以涟漪符 号表示，其伤害基 于攻击者的特攻和 承受者的特防进行 计算
Targeting
招式目标
Most moves target only a single Pokémon, but many can target multiple Pokémon at once. Some moves differ in how far they can target in the bigger battle styles (doubles, triples).
大多数招式只针对 单一目标，但也有 很多带有群攻能力 的招式，很多有与 目标距离限制的招 式，这些在双打、 三打中会起到不同 效果
Move Types
招式属性
Every move has a type. Attacking moves deal different amounts of damage to different Pokémon based on those Pokémon's types. This is called 'type effectiveness'.
每个招式都有一种 属性，攻击会根据 攻击者和承受者的 属性不同，造成不 同伤害
Same-Type Bonus
本系奖励
Pokémon deal 50% more damage with moves the share a type with them. For example, a Raichu deals 50% more damage with an Electric move than a Normal move.
宝可梦使用与自己 属性相同的招式， 会提升招式额外50 %的威力
Learning Moves
学习招式
Pokémon learn new moves as they level up. They can also learn moves from the 'Move Tutors' who sit in the left side of every PokéCenter.
宝可梦在升级过程 中可以学到新招式 ，还可以在宝可梦 中心左侧的NPC 处回忆或学到其他 宝可梦的招式
Base Power
基础威力
Moves with higher Base Power deal more damage. Some moves deal variable Base Power depending on the situation. Status moves have no base power.
基础威力越高的招 式伤害越高，有些 招式的基础威力会 发生改变，变化类 招式没有威力
Accuracy is a move's chance of hitting. Most moves have 100% accuracy. Some effects can raise accuracy to let you use low-accuracy moves consistently.
大多数招式的命中 率都是100%，游 戏中同时有提升命 中的方式，确保低 命中的招式也能产 生效果
Power Points
PP
Power Points, or PP, is a number which limits how many times a move can be used. Healing at a PokéCenter or with the Aid Kit restores PP.
PP点数是一个招式 的使用次数，在宝 可梦中心恢复或者 使用医疗包都会对 其进行恢复
Each Pokémon has type weakness and type resistances based on its own type. eg. Water deals double damage to Fire, and Fire deals half damage to Water.
每种宝可梦都有基 于自身属性的弱点 和抗性，如火弱水 ，水抗火。
Type Combinations
双/多属性
When a Pokémon has two types, its type weaknesses and resistances multiply. A Pokémon can be double weak or double resistant, or immune even though one of their types is weak.
当宝可梦有两种属 性时，它的弱点和 抗性就会相互叠加 ，因此有可能会有 非常克制或非常惧 怕的属性。
Normal Effective
效果正常
Normal Effective is the default effectiveness of all moves against a Pokémon.
效果正常值的是对 其造成的招式伤害 为默认效果。
Super Effective
效果较好
Super Effective moves deal double the damage compared to normal effective moves.

Hyper Effective
效果极佳
Hyper Effective moves deal quadruple the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a Pokémon is double weak to a type.
效果极佳的招式伤 害是正常的四倍。
Not Very Effective
效果不佳
Not Very Effective moves deal half the damage compared to normal effective moves.
效果不佳的招式伤 害是正常的一半。
Barely Effective
效果极差
Barely Effective moves deal one quarter the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a Pokémon is double resistant to a type.
效果极差的招式伤 害是正常的四分之 一。
Ineffective
免疫
Ineffective moves deal no damage at all. This can happen if one of a Pokémon's types has an immunity to the attacking move type, even if the other is neutral (or even weak!).
无效的招式不会造 成任何伤害，只要 宝可梦拥有一个免 疫对方的属性，即 可生效。
Looking Up Matchups
对战情况
The 5th and 6th pages of a MasterDex entry show that Pokémon's type matchups. Open the MasterDex in battle to check matchups if you're not sure.
大师图鉴的第5、6 页显示了宝可梦的 属性相关，不确定 的话可以在战斗中 打开图鉴查看。
Psychic vs Steel
超能和钢
Psychic is now Super-Effective vs Steel. Think of magicians bending spoons.
超能属性现在克制 钢系，想想魔术师 的勺子吧

Other changes
其它改动
Rock resists Ice. Fairy resists Dragon. Fairy is neutral against Fire. Bug resists Psychic.
岩石属性可以抵抗 冰属性，妖精属性 不再免疫龙属性， 火属性抵抗妖精属 性，虫属性可以抵 抗超能属性
Why Get More?
需培养更多
Having choices of Pokémon is important when facing challenges. A team of six is a bare minimum--it's best to catch more and pull them from the PC as needed.
每种宝可梦都有根 据自己的属性确定 的弱点，因此在应 对特定对手时，最 好更改队伍配置
Methods of Aquiring
宝可梦获取
The two main methods of acquiring Pokémon are catching them from the wild, and receiving them from other Trainers through gifts or trades.
获得宝可梦的方式 主要有两种，一是 从野外进行捕捉， 二是通过交易或交 换从其他训练家手 里获得
Catching Basics
捕捉常识
Wild Pokémon will attack you if you walk through patches of grass, dark ground in caves, or other wild terrain. You can catch these Pokémon by throwing Poké Balls at them.
在草丛、洞穴中的 黑色地板或者其他 特殊地形时，就会 遇到野生宝可梦， 可以通过向它们扔 宝可梦球的方式将 其捕获
Increase Catch Chance pt. 1
捕获率 上
Catching a Pokémon isn't guaranteed. It's easier to catch Pokémon when their health has been lowered by your attacks, or when they have a status ailment.
当野生宝可梦的H P被降低，或者受 到异常状态影响后 ，就能更轻松地捉 住它们了
Increase Catch Chance pt. 2
捕获率 下
Every time a Pokémon breaks out of a ball, it'll be slightly easier to catch for the rest of the battle. You can check what your current catch chance is in the Poké Ball menu.
每当宝可梦从球里 出来，它的捕捉率 都会进一步增加， 而且可以在宝可梦 球的菜单中查看捕 捉几率
Finding Wild Pokémon
寻找野生宝可梦
Use the DexNav to get information on which Pokémon are available where you are. You can also use it to find more Pokémon of a species that you've already caught one of.
使用检索功能可以 查看附近有哪些宝 可梦，你可以使用 这个功能寻找更多 新的宝可梦
Trades
交换
Throughout the world there will be people offering trades for Pokémon. Usually they want a different Pokémon, but sometimes they want money.
世界各地都会有愿 意交换宝可梦的人 ，只要将打算交换 的宝可梦放在箱子 中，就可以与他们 交换了
What are Stats?
什么是能力值
Stats, short for Statistics, are the numbers which determine how your Pokémon performs in battle.
能力值决定着你的 宝可梦在战斗中的 能力表现，以数字 形式展示
Checking Stats
查看能力值
Check your Pokémon's stats by looking at the second page of their summary screen, accessible through the Pokémon menu in the pause menu.
在战斗中可以通过 详情菜单，查看战 斗时的数据统计
Stat Factors
统计要素
Your Pokémon's stats are calculated from a combination of their species' 'Base Stats', their own 'Style Points', and extra modifications during battle.
宝可梦的能力是根 据其基础能力、风 格点数和战斗中额 外获得的修正等级 综合算出的
Base Stats

Which section would you like to read?

Or, to state it another way, they can't use the same move type twice in a row.
