Over and out."1Uh -- yes? Did you want to ask me something?"LWell then don't -- can you not -- I'm not a big fan of being stared at."’I just like... Iâ€™m a wanderer. Or, rather, not a wanderer -- but I don't have a home -- or, well -- excuse me. I spend most of my time in caves."I don't know? I mean -- no, I know, but rather I'm not sure why -- I mean, what kind of question is that? I'm a PokÃ©mon trainer."AOr I was. And Iâ€™m... rather good at it. And not much else."bA friend's. Just a friend's. I'm good at -- they entrust me with the training. I get results."aI mean, that sounds -- that's not what I really meant. I'm -- I'm -- I was -- let's move on."(Heyo, \PN. Hear youâ€™ve been busy."YYouâ€™re just racking up badges like theyâ€™re nothing, huh? Mavis must be so proud."5Itâ€™s not a compliment. Just stating the facts."~And the fact is that youâ€™re not getting anywhere now unless you come meet me, for reasons that make me too angry to explain."*Iâ€™ve got a <imp>gift</imp> for you."“Iâ€™m literally friends with two - I mean ONE - of those gym leaders, and I was the commanding officer for half the people keeping track of Rafael."Word gets around."kI also know that youâ€™re gonna have some issues getting <imp>across that river</imp> without my help."Yikes."Yeah, Mavis isâ€¦ Mavis."CYou know, youâ€¦ ah, nevermind. Eye on the prize and all that."JSpeaking of which, you need to get <imp>across the river</imp>, yeah?"0We might be able to reach an arrangement...")But. But... you know how this works."TQuid pro quo, yeah? I know youâ€™ve scratched a few avatars off of my hit list."TGonna be clear as crystal here: youâ€™re doing better than most of the rangers."\Such as the ones that recently just got mauled by a particularly ornery Steelix avatar."SYou know me so well. Put the thing in the ground â€“ well, more in the ground."cItâ€™s ripping through the mine yard in <imp>Grouz</imp> at the moment, which isâ€¦ a problem."YIf it goes down particular routes we could be facing a VERY uncomfortable situation."IThe rangers? Dealing with rampaging Tauros and crossroads hauntings."gAvatars are out of their paygrade. Not that we donâ€™t send them in anyways and hope for the best."hSpeaking of which: <imp>Grouz</imp>. Squad went out and didnâ€™t leave a scratch on the damn thing."/You can split it right open, though, yeah?"YYou donâ€™t know what busy looks like, kid. You think Iâ€™m not trying to work here?"fI know you cut a deal with Helena. Same here: you accelerate my timetable, I do the same for you."USo make your way down to <imp>Grouz</imp> and turn that Steelix to slag. Please?"rIâ€™ll check back in on you when I hear that behemothâ€™s gone. Promise Iâ€™ll make it worth your while, too."Capisce? Good. Bye."â€¦She hung up."ABefore you can put your phone away, it starts ringing again."%It seems like an important call."*\PN, I need your help. Itâ€™s urgent."4You know the <imp>catacombs</imp> under Prizca?"JThereâ€™s an entrance in the <imp>sewers</imp>. I need you here, now."ZIâ€™ll explain when you get here â€“ this isnâ€™t the most secure way to communicate."DItâ€™s bad, though. Real bad. I need a trainer of your caliber."[Thanks. I know this is sudden, but I canâ€™t overstate how much I need your help ASAP."JListen, kid, if I could call in a couple Chasm strike teams, I would."uBut things change, and now all I have is you. You are NOT going to like the consequences if you donâ€™t help me."Please."=Bring the best team youâ€™ve got. Itâ€™s gonna get ugly."?Hey, just checking in. Whatâ€™s going on? Making progress?"SOh, wow. Really trying your liâ€™l heart out, arenâ€™t you? More than one gym!",Ah, donâ€™t get all broken up about it."[You could be in the big city with six badges under your belt and it wouldnâ€™t matter."Why, I never."6Havenâ€™t you heard bloodâ€™s thicker than water?""Practically a type advantage.")Well, whatever -- keep your secrets."8As for me, Iâ€™m taking a break before facing Noel."nYou donâ€™t know him -- and, letâ€™s be honest, you probably never will -- but heâ€™s kind of a big deal."bSo while youâ€™re scuttling to and fro like a Falinks without an officer, Iâ€™ll be relaxing."Wish you were here!"He hung upâ€¦"(Wow, that wasâ€¦ a complete breeze."A joke, honestly."&Thatâ€™s my sixth badge now. You?"Wow. I remember that."1Wait, how did you even schedule a challenge?"4I made an appointment before I got on the ship."2You... you're serious about this, aren't you?"That canâ€™t be right."Youâ€™re better than that."UNot by much, but if youâ€™re lying, thenâ€¦ youâ€™re taking this seriously. Huh."Hah! That never gets old."LYou remind me ofâ€¦ I guess a Zangoose, right? So angry, but so normal.",But you are really angry, arenâ€™t you?"\Well, youâ€™ve certainly made good time, but this is where things start getting harder."1Youâ€™ve still got a lot of ground to cover."!See you at the championship!"4Iâ€™ll make sure to look in the stands for you."He hung upâ€¦ again."/Hey, \PN. Things going well on your front?"0Good. Youâ€™ve got eight badges now, right?"xThatâ€™s... itâ€™s something. Youâ€™ll excuse me if Iâ€™m not too preoccupied with the whole gym challenge shebang."That makes one of us."KBetween the avatars and... recent developments... Iâ€™ve been swamped."XYeah, frickinâ€™ tell me about it. I know exactly what youâ€™re talking about, too."ZListen: I know the stress is probably getting to you, but weâ€™re in the endgame now."_Be a hero, become Champion, go home to Mavis. Everyoneâ€™s happy, right? Smiles all round."(So, yeah, just a liâ€™l bit longer."}Take down those avatars if you can spare the time, come back to Prizca for the Championship, and... weâ€™ll see about Yezera."&Thanks, \PN. I know itâ€™s a lot."Thanks."MWhoever the hell it is helping Yezera, theyâ€™ve been making the rounds."iGood news is that you seem to be their priority. Havenâ€™t been, yâ€™know, rampaging. Which is good."Iâ€™ve had zero luck trying to track them down. Iâ€™d hire Alessa again if sheâ€™d return my calls â€“ but, hey, thatâ€™s why I have you, right?"Yes and no. Youâ€™re gonna have to cut through some of the best trainers in the region, but it ainâ€™t just busywork this time."jNot that it ever is â€“ thanks, by the way â€“ but this one should be especially interesting for you."jThatâ€™s what I like to hear. This ainâ€™t gonna be an easy operation, but I trust in your abilities."gMostly in committing violence. Lots of violence. Though, actually, maybe try talking this one out?"4Youâ€™re gonna want to hear this one. Trust me."wI mean, youâ€™ve got a minute before the Championship anyways. This op is... itâ€™s pretty dire, importance- wise."gIâ€™ve got a confirmed sighting on Yezera. Sheâ€™s back in her hometown â€“ <imp>Whitebloom</imp>."eYezeraâ€™s got a few titans on her and some kind of master plan, so sheâ€™s your first priority."a\PN... thanks in advance. Try and be understanding with Yezera. Sheâ€™s... dealt with a lot." But do what you have to do."\Do what you have to do, come back to Prizca for the tournament, and go home a Champion."$Happy endings all-round, right?"Right. Bye."GHey-o! Been a lil' bit but I managed to pry your number from Zain."aSucks that I couldn't face you in the Tournament, but I've got a surprise to make up for it!"cHeard about this place called the <imp>Battle Monument</imp>. It's for top trainers to battle."zThey're weird about directly inviting people, but you're a champion so you should just waltz right in. It'll be fine."XI'll send the GPS coordinates to you so you can sail on over and give it a looksie."kOh yeah, guess I didn't say before, but the Battle Monument is a big tower in the middle of the ocean."IIf I didn't know better, I'd think it was some evil villainous lair."BAnyways, I'll still be hanging around the Tournament grounds."tThere's still lots of trainers here, and I've got some new team configurations I really wanna try against them!"..."t...Ok yeah someone here just asked to battle me, and I'm not gonna turn that down, so I gotta end the call now."VHope you're doing well, be safe, make good choices, have fun, et cetera. Bye bye!"â€¦They hung up.",They must really want to talk with you."dA couple seconds later, you receive a text message with the coordinates to the Battle Monument."Hello to you, young one."It is I, Dr. Hekata."TDo not worry about how I learned of your cellphone number. I simply divined it."2I have a topic to discuss of some importance."PI beseech youâ€”<imp>visit my abode in Grouz</imp>. There we shall discuss."DApologies for the interruption to your adventure, young master."wHowever, given that you've sent a number of Pokemon to Storage, I thought it best that I inform you of my project."GTo make it short: Your family owns an unused Estate here in Makya."pSince you're taking on the Makyan Gym Challenge, I took the initiative to renovate the grounds for our use."dI've set up a system that sends the Pokemon you store in your PC to this <imp>PokÃ‰state</imp>."GI'll take care of them there while you are busy with your journey."pI love Pokemon variety, so I've prepared lots of <imp>EXP Candy</imp> to give you as your collection grows."COnce you've earned some, I'll send them to you through the PC."nI'll continue to wait for you on the boat. If you want to visit the PokÃ‰state, send me a ping at any PC."%I'll take you there immediately."?That is all. I will distract you no further, young master."A\i[TAROTAMULET]The Tarot Amulet spasms like something dying."uYou feel your pupils dilate and somewhere bleak and broken almost comes into view at the corners of your vision."SA womanâ€™s voice whispers from that place â€“ almost familiar, but not quite."8You shouldnâ€™t have reversed that amulet, dearest."<The woman who gave it to you was trying to protect you."QNow, though, charms for safe beginnings turn to invitations of dire endings."gMaybe thereâ€™s something to learn from interlacing your journey with the path of ordeals, though."zEnjoy this brief, bitter taste of the end, darling, and Iâ€™ll try and pull some strings should you prove victorious."3\i[TAROTAMULET]Once again the amulet twitches."UOnce again, you can almost make something out, just past your peripheral vision."Once again, she speaks."(Oh? Youâ€™re back, dearest. Lovely."UThese people are tied inextricably to this regionâ€™s secrets; its conspiracies."oLet me implant a bit of my demesne into theirs, and I might be able to tease them open like a faulty lock."@You want to know more, donâ€™t you? Want them to trust you?")Then prepare to enjoy another trial.",\i[TAROTAMULET]Itâ€™s the amulet again."^It isnâ€™t the thing itself thatâ€™s in pain. No, something else is â€“ something larger."'Something is wrong in this region.",Another challenge, another opportunity."yI never put much stock into mysticism until my hand was forced. Iâ€™m so glad to see my investment paying dividends."MThese people donâ€™t even know Iâ€™m threading their fate through yours!"cI paint an impressed expression on their malleable faces â€“ so long as you can walk the walk."/Go on, dearest. You know the rules by now."R\i[TAROTAMULET]The reversed amulet spasms and the other place impends on you."-That voiceâ€¦ itâ€™s painfully familiar."*Oh, you already know who I am, child."nIâ€™m the one thatâ€™s waiting for you at the end of the line. The end of your lineâ€¦ and of every line."&Makya is a place rich in history."VThatâ€™s why you endure these tastes of my demesne, isnâ€™t it? To learn history?"=Well, even history ends. Youâ€™ll understand eventually."6Go on. Show me what a conqueror you are, darling."Z\i[TAROTAMULET]At this point, you can almost hear fate whimpering through the amulet."3Her voice shushes it, but does not comfort it."€Where did Imogene get this thing? I doubt she realized the significance of the sliver of stone she implanted within this amulet."QIt was uplifted from a forbidden place where history is tortuous and frayed."„Its latent power, the witchâ€™s arcana, and, of course, myâ€¦ expertiseâ€¦ all aligned to make my little bits of influence possible."-I hope you feel lucky, darling: you are."Always."\i[TAROTAMULET]....."MThereâ€™s something calming about the hellscape you can almost perceive."*Itâ€™s a calm hell; quiet and somber." Her voice is much the same."If only I could twist these gym leadersâ€™ roles without having to suffuse their arenas with my demesne and all itsâ€¦ antipathy."*History ends quietly, but not kindly."OHere, our day-to-day lives are much like what you endure in these battles."Oh, donâ€™t pity me. My only point is that I would gladly spare you the intensity of fateâ€™s dying gasps if I could, trust me."Trust me, darling."v\i[TAROTAMULET]As the amulet twists and writhes, you can feel the tension of invisible threads being pulled taut."8They are wrapped around the amulet, and around you."sSomewhere behind you they frayed into thousands of strands, and ahead of you they extend to somewhere distant."There they all end.":You understand by now, donâ€™t you? Makya is history.">You, darling, are a history to me â€“ a singular history."3And I am a singular history projected forward."You have the benefit of what weâ€™ll call a privileged reference frame, and I thank you dearly for letting me glimpse through your eyes at it."0Not to mention making a fewâ€¦ alterations."+Donâ€™t think too hard on it, dearest.".\i[TAROTAMULET]The amulet has gone still."^Something is changing â€“ the threads are being woven back together, or severed, or both."4Someone is taking matters into their own hands."No, that isnâ€™t me."0We both know who it is, though, donâ€™t we?"dYou should probably stop her from doing that, or one of us could end up in the otherâ€™s place."IYou were not made for the terminus, and I was not made for a utopia."=And no human was made for the paradise sheâ€™s planning.",â€¦\PN, you know who I am, donâ€™t you?"]We wonâ€™t be speaking for a little while, but know that Iâ€™m watching over you, child."My child."â€¦Agonizingly familiar."[But, still, she is a stranger to you, this woman who almost has your motherâ€™s voice."No."Why are you down here?"Who are you?"Whose PokÃ©mon are those?"How do you know?"I doubt it."You want it gone?"What are they good for?"I'm busy."

@keys[ï"Breaking News!"lI'm live here at <imp>Tri Island</imp>, a mysterious island discovered recently off the coast of Makya."€Trainers from all over the world are making their way over as there have been sightings of extremely rare Pokemon and resources."‰With no region claiming major jurisdiction over the island, there have been reports of multiple factions creating base camps in the area."}The only thing that's certain here is the battling as Trainers duke it out over territory and access to these new wild areas."NBut for now, we'll be providing live coverage of the event. Over and out."1Uh -- yes? Did you want to ask me something?"LWell then don't -- can you not -- I'm not a big fan of being stared at."’I just like... Iâ€™m a wanderer. Or, rather, not a wanderer -- but I don't have a home -- or, well -- excuse me. I spend most of my time in caves."I don't know? I mean -- no, I know, but rather I'm not sure why -- I mean, what kind of question is that? I'm a PokÃ©mon trainer."AOr I was. And Iâ€™m... rather good at it. And not much else."bA friend's. Just a friend's. I'm good at -- they entrust me with the training. I get results."aI mean, that sounds -- that's not what I really meant. I'm -- I'm -- I was -- let's move on."(Heyo, \PN. Hear youâ€™ve been busy."YYouâ€™re just racking up badges like theyâ€™re nothing, huh? Mavis must be so proud."5Itâ€™s not a compliment. Just stating the facts."~And the fact is that youâ€™re not getting anywhere now unless you come meet me, for reasons that make me too angry to explain."*Iâ€™ve got a <imp>gift</imp> for you."“Iâ€™m literally friends with two - I mean ONE - of those gym leaders, and I was the commanding officer for half the people keeping track of Rafael."Word gets around."kI also know that youâ€™re gonna have some issues getting <imp>across that river</imp> without my help."Yikes."Yeah, Mavis isâ€¦ Mavis."CYou know, youâ€¦ ah, nevermind. Eye on the prize and all that."JSpeaking of which, you need to get <imp>across the river</imp>, yeah?"0We might be able to reach an arrangement...")But. But... you know how this works."TQuid pro quo, yeah? I know youâ€™ve scratched a few avatars off of my hit list."TGonna be clear as crystal here: youâ€™re doing better than most of the rangers."\Such as the ones that recently just got mauled by a particularly ornery Steelix avatar."SYou know me so well. Put the thing in the ground â€“ well, more in the ground."cItâ€™s ripping through the mine yard in <imp>Grouz</imp> at the moment, which isâ€¦ a problem."YIf it goes down particular routes we could be facing a VERY uncomfortable situation."IThe rangers? Dealing with rampaging Tauros and crossroads hauntings."gAvatars are out of their paygrade. Not that we donâ€™t send them in anyways and hope for the best."hSpeaking of which: <imp>Grouz</imp>. Squad went out and didnâ€™t leave a scratch on the damn thing."/You can split it right open, though, yeah?"YYou donâ€™t know what busy looks like, kid. You think Iâ€™m not trying to work here?"fI know you cut a deal with Helena. Same here: you accelerate my timetable, I do the same for you."USo make your way down to <imp>Grouz</imp> and turn that Steelix to slag. Please?"rIâ€™ll check back in on you when I hear that behemothâ€™s gone. Promise Iâ€™ll make it worth your while, too."Capisce? Good. Bye."â€¦She hung up."ABefore you can put your phone away, it starts ringing again."%It seems like an important call."*\PN, I need your help. Itâ€™s urgent."4You know the <imp>catacombs</imp> under Prizca?"JThereâ€™s an entrance in the <imp>sewers</imp>. I need you here, now."ZIâ€™ll explain when you get here â€“ this isnâ€™t the most secure way to communicate."DItâ€™s bad, though. Real bad. I need a trainer of your caliber."[Thanks. I know this is sudden, but I canâ€™t overstate how much I need your help ASAP."JListen, kid, if I could call in a couple Chasm strike teams, I would."uBut things change, and now all I have is you. You are NOT going to like the consequences if you donâ€™t help me."Please."=Bring the best team youâ€™ve got. Itâ€™s gonna get ugly."?Hey, just checking in. Whatâ€™s going on? Making progress?"SOh, wow. Really trying your liâ€™l heart out, arenâ€™t you? More than one gym!",Ah, donâ€™t get all broken up about it."[You could be in the big city with six badges under your belt and it wouldnâ€™t matter."Why, I never."6Havenâ€™t you heard bloodâ€™s thicker than water?""Practically a type advantage.")Well, whatever -- keep your secrets."8As for me, Iâ€™m taking a break before facing Noel."nYou donâ€™t know him -- and, letâ€™s be honest, you probably never will -- but heâ€™s kind of a big deal."bSo while youâ€™re scuttling to and fro like a Falinks without an officer, Iâ€™ll be relaxing."Wish you were here!"He hung upâ€¦"(Wow, that wasâ€¦ a complete breeze."A joke, honestly."&Thatâ€™s my sixth badge now. You?"Wow. I remember that."1Wait, how did you even schedule a challenge?"4I made an appointment before I got on the ship."2You... you're serious about this, aren't you?"That canâ€™t be right."Youâ€™re better than that."UNot by much, but if youâ€™re lying, thenâ€¦ youâ€™re taking this seriously. Huh."Hah! That never gets old."LYou remind me ofâ€¦ I guess a Zangoose, right? So angry, but so normal.",But you are really angry, arenâ€™t you?"\Well, youâ€™ve certainly made good time, but this is where things start getting harder."1Youâ€™ve still got a lot of ground to cover."!See you at the championship!"4Iâ€™ll make sure to look in the stands for you."He hung upâ€¦ again."/Hey, \PN. Things going well on your front?"0Good. Youâ€™ve got eight badges now, right?"xThatâ€™s... itâ€™s something. Youâ€™ll excuse me if Iâ€™m not too preoccupied with the whole gym challenge shebang."That makes one of us."KBetween the avatars and... recent developments... Iâ€™ve been swamped."XYeah, frickinâ€™ tell me about it. I know exactly what youâ€™re talking about, too."ZListen: I know the stress is probably getting to you, but weâ€™re in the endgame now."_Be a hero, become Champion, go home to Mavis. Everyoneâ€™s happy, right? Smiles all round."(So, yeah, just a liâ€™l bit longer."}Take down those avatars if you can spare the time, come back to Prizca for the Championship, and... weâ€™ll see about Yezera."&Thanks, \PN. I know itâ€™s a lot."Thanks."MWhoever the hell it is helping Yezera, theyâ€™ve been making the rounds."iGood news is that you seem to be their priority. Havenâ€™t been, yâ€™know, rampaging. Which is good."Iâ€™ve had zero luck trying to track them down. Iâ€™d hire Alessa again if sheâ€™d return my calls â€“ but, hey, thatâ€™s why I have you, right?"Yes and no. Youâ€™re gonna have to cut through some of the best trainers in the region, but it ainâ€™t just busywork this time."jNot that it ever is â€“ thanks, by the way â€“ but this one should be especially interesting for you."jThatâ€™s what I like to hear. This ainâ€™t gonna be an easy operation, but I trust in your abilities."gMostly in committing violence. Lots of violence. Though, actually, maybe try talking this one out?"4Youâ€™re gonna want to hear this one. Trust me."wI mean, youâ€™ve got a minute before the Championship anyways. This op is... itâ€™s pretty dire, importance- wise."gIâ€™ve got a confirmed sighting on Yezera. Sheâ€™s back in her hometown â€“ <imp>Whitebloom</imp>."eYezeraâ€™s got a few titans on her and some kind of master plan, so sheâ€™s your first priority."a\PN... thanks in advance. Try and be understanding with Yezera. Sheâ€™s... dealt with a lot." But do what you have to do."\Do what you have to do, come back to Prizca for the tournament, and go home a Champion."$Happy endings all-round, right?"Right. Bye."GHey-o! Been a lil' bit but I managed to pry your number from Zain."aSucks that I couldn't face you in the Tournament, but I've got a surprise to make up for it!"cHeard about this place called the <imp>Battle Monument</imp>. It's for top trainers to battle."zThey're weird about directly inviting people, but you're a champion so you should just waltz right in. It'll be fine."XI'll send the GPS coordinates to you so you can sail on over and give it a looksie."kOh yeah, guess I didn't say before, but the Battle Monument is a big tower in the middle of the ocean."IIf I didn't know better, I'd think it was some evil villainous lair."BAnyways, I'll still be hanging around the Tournament grounds."tThere's still lots of trainers here, and I've got some new team configurations I really wanna try against them!"..."t...Ok yeah someone here just asked to battle me, and I'm not gonna turn that down, so I gotta end the call now."VHope you're doing well, be safe, make good choices, have fun, et cetera. Bye bye!"â€¦They hung up.",They must really want to talk with you."dA couple seconds later, you receive a text message with the coordinates to the Battle Monument."Hello to you, young one."It is I, Dr. Hekata."TDo not worry about how I learned of your cellphone number.

Honestly, it seems like it just wants to forget this ever happened."nJirachi seems disappointed.

Recent excursions have promised field-shaking discoveries."The avatar crisis has only existed for less than half a year, but already fossil analysis has found striking resemblances to ancient Pokemon."lSkeletons found by researchers are significantly larger than the bone structure of modern counterparts."DNovo College has an accoladed history in the material sciences."fThe Rematerializer was voted by Trainers as one of the most useful inventions in the last decade."WWe also work closely with Pokemon Centers in order to improve medicinal practices."kMakya has a stunningly biodiverse ecosystem, which has raised the mystery of how it got to that point."zOne theory is that immigration to the region has brought stowaway Pokemon, or foreign Pokemon released into the wild."QAnother theory is the Makyan environmental policy is particularly effective."“For both theories, the counterargument is that fossil records show that Makya has had this biodiversity before human settlements were even founded."{In collaboration with Eko, Novo Town's Gym Leader, Novo Colllege is developing new pain-relief medication for Pokemon."rWhile status-relieving medicine serves a purpose, its main flaw is that it is reactive rather than proactive."€As a response to this issue, the College has been working to develop a new ointment, which can be applied to Pokemon once a day."RUnlike existing medicines, it serves to stop status pains before they happen."zPokemon in the midst of battle will still feel the effects, long-term pain will be numbed a few minutes after combat."Career battling Pokemon benefit most from this, as continued exposure to untreated status can result in chronic pains once the Pokemon retires from battling."ŠThe avatar crisis has disrupted much of Makya's already strained infrastructure, as travel between settlements has become quite dangerous."}To help combat this, Novo College has been offering free courses to Trainers and Rangers who wish to keep Makyan routes safe."]Multiple professors and students work to develop new strategies to defeat these avatars."nExperienced Trainers with a history of battling avatars are encouraged to volunteer in educational roles."|One of the College's latest projects involved tracking genetic signatures in the Golett, Baltoy, and Castform families."qWhile the exact methods of reproduction elude scientists, many suspect that selection forces remain at play."ƒHow this natural selection impacts man-made Pokemon could have remarkable insights on how other Pokemon change form over millennia."9Applications for the current school year are closed."1Acceptance letters will be sent out shortly."[LuxTech Scholars will be contacted by a representative on their first week of classes.">Our college isn't too grand, but we have three ace areas."0Paleontology, 3D printing, and electronics."`When you combine them, you get the largest fossil studies and revival program in the world!"No"Yes"You're stealing PokÃ©mon?"You're rescuing PokÃ©mon?"

I suggest a duel."4The loser will tell the victor the whole truth."
Good."aThat may be so. Dedicated trainers seem to have some kind of honor to their matches, though."ƒI would like to ensure you are telling me everything. It seems as if a loss may compel you to reveal what you would otherwise hide."ZThose are my conditions. I will fight you before I have anything more to do with you.")If you would like to leave, you may."7Yes. What honor compels you trainers is beyond me."tI plan to uphold my end of the deal, though. I believe your bizarre code of conduct will force you to, as well."LNow, if you would like time to prepare, or simply to escape, do so now." If not, then we shall duel."Go. Iâ€™ll wait."^I understand you are the current Champion. I am more skilled than you may expect, though."!You returned. Are you ready?"SYes, well, I suppose I expected this. The odds of beating a Champion were low."{I did the best I could, and now I will tell you the whole truth. Maybe your response will tell me what I want to know."MI have discovered the locations of at least four of the five Regi tombs."œI am also aware of Yezeraâ€™s abduction of the Regis, and that some part of her plan has caused the avatars. My final finding is that... none of it matters."Not for my purposes."…Makya is a large, vibrant ecosystem. The pressures which generate a new regional form are more complicated than one can simply infer."SIn my pride, I thought an outsiderâ€™s perspective could unravel this mystery."~The Regis, the avatars, the regional forms â€“ all connected, of course, but not cleanly. The world is not a clean place."cI am glad you agree. If you had a simple solution I had missed, I would be rather embarrassed."uEven a negative result is worth determining for certain. I donâ€™t have answers. I do have experience, and data."jYes. I plan to prove my abilities in more realistic ways than solving an entire regionâ€™s mysteries."BI donâ€™t. Iâ€™ve determined my problem. Now Iâ€™m fixing it."HBut I am also not finished, as I have only told you half the truth.">My challenge and this location were for a higher purpose."¤I noted Makyaâ€™s vast diversity of species and set my sights on a particular trio. Prior to this moment, they have only been found in an extremely specific locale."KBut, drawn by the sound of brutal conflict, in a place such as this..."Pulp and Fantasy"kConflict against a hero such as you, in a location similar to their home such as this, draws them out."II have been untrue, however. I have fought you before. I was masked."…I have determined I have made a mistake there, too. Primordial truth would elude us even if the world is reverted. There is no point."„The world is complicated, and always has been. My inability to solve such a relatively-trivial mystery suggests my plan was foolish."cPlease excuse my repeated deceptions. I did, in fact, determine quite a bit of this on my own."sThe nature of the regional forms is still a pursuit of mine. I plan to continue it, so Yezera must be stopped."ŒIf you wish, I would suggest you take these birds of the battlefield with you. I planned to use them against you. Now I suggest the reverse."qI will leave you to your preparations. I have many years of study left in Makya, and plan to not waste them."NI rest easy knowing you will not let my efforts be in vain. Goodbye, \PN.")There they are.

Itâ€™s why Iâ€™m here."nI could be the one to track her down, lure her out like a timid beast. I just wanted to take care of her."~And she was beautiful, of course.

Fine."Yâ€™know, fine, whatever."?You get what everyone else I fight gets. What you deserve."?Regirock â€“ your watch is over.

I do."SOr I can remain in this world forever a stranger, wandering without a purpose.""Would you condemn me to that?"1The Championship is getting close, you know."RIâ€™ll wait for you.

Absolutely none."XOther than the immense enjoyment Iâ€™m about to extract from dismantling your team."EA friend of Yezeraâ€™s. Besides that, Iâ€™m masked for a reason."iI would ask who you are, but quite frankly it doesnâ€™t matter. Iâ€™m going to find out soon enough."9Thereâ€™s only so many types of people in the world.":I just told you: because humiliating you will be fun."MUnless you mean extracting Regidrago, in which case, no, I wonâ€™t tell."bHumans have this infuriatingly self-destructive need to tell secrets. Iâ€™m better than that."3Well, I see the dialogueâ€™s broken down fast."Fine. Suffer."6But I didnâ€™t come here to engage in small talk."iI assure you, it isnâ€™t personal â€“ no one has anything interesting to say. Youâ€™re no exception."WBut you are exceptionally skilled, I understand, and thatâ€™s correlated with ego."5Allow me to show you what youâ€™re really worth."Vâ€¦Ah, so be it. I doubt I could drill humility through your thick skull anyways."=Youâ€™re good at playing shallow games â€“ good for you."1A Totem calls. Iâ€™ve seen more than enough."bThey got away. They won. A few that were masked, and whoever the hell THAT was. And Yezeraâ€¦"UWish I knew. That guy was a narcissist and an asshole, I can tell you that much."#The rest of themâ€¦ who knows."Could be anything."jBut if they were after Regidrago specifically, and Yezeraâ€™s with themâ€¦ maybe even leading themâ€¦"4â€¦I donâ€™t know. It doesnâ€™t make any sense.">She should be the last person to pull this kind of stunt."XIt is. Itâ€™s your problem now, and I know you arenâ€™t gonna like that, but it is."5This is bigger than just one legendary PokÃ©mon."4Remember what I said about the big open secret?"oThe caves around Makya are tombs for the Regis. The weird ones I was talking about before. Ones like this."NWell, some archaeological teams went to study them a couple decades back."yAnd then they found the Regis, and the rich mineral veins, and the ruins, and they figured they could leverage that."{We got some corporate backing from Andris and Mavis, and boom: Team Chasm. I was one of those original archaeologists."nâ€¦Some of us. Helena wanted to run her own region. Andris wanted a piece of the organized crime bigtime."QMe, I study the Regis. And some people wanted me to leave well enough alone."jI had a Team and Regidrago on my side, and they didnâ€™t, so I got to study what I damn well pleased."LSome of us. I didnâ€™t. I had five Regis â€“ what did I need money for?"8If I wanted lab equipment, I sent a list to Helena."GI lived in a research station and ate ramen. Best days of my life."oI just wanted to study the Regis, and with their power, nobody could tell me no. Funny how that works out.")You make it sound so pure and noble."bI was curious. Wanted answers. I got them â€“ who could tell me no with Regidrago at my side?"YNot to mention the full might of Team Chasm, 'cause my research was VERY profitable."QIâ€™m getting to that, but also, hey, it could come in handy some day, yeah?"5As I was saying: we found the five lesser Regis."\It took me years, but I deciphered their inscriptions and understood their true nature."JThat led us to Regigigas, and at that point we were cooking with gas."RGigas was stronger than the rest of the Regis put together, and smarter, too."|Shape the earth, revert it back to some kind of primordial clay. Create seals and wards that nothing could get through."2And, yeah, it could throw a mean Giga Impact."iIt could doâ€¦ other things, too. We found a way to make it create ethereal PokÃ©mon with its power.";They were hostile, powerful â€“ had to be locked away."}And then by the time Yezera kicked down our door and told us to stop, she was basically just confirming what we already knew."pWe were playing with fire. If we kept using Regigigas, we ran the very real chance of destroying the world."`Or at least permanently changing it. So we put each Regi back in their tomb and went legit."iThe tombs were reinforced, of course â€“ just about nothing can get through the minor Regi chambers."KGigasâ€™s chamber can only be opened by the other five Regis together."_I donâ€™t know. She agreed with us: it was too dangerous. We were criminals, not lunatics."MI know thingsâ€¦ havenâ€™t been great for her, but this? This is insane."[Who knows. We knew some groups were trying to get them back â€“ they always have been."PBut succeeding? There was no way. Impossible. Butâ€¦ apparently Yezera can."*â€¦Probably. They might already have."nGigasâ€™s chamber is deep down, though, and if they havenâ€™t broken the seal yet, itâ€™d be for nothing."QOr if theyâ€™ve resealed it. I can try and scout it out, butâ€¦ no promises."^My POINT is that if you donâ€™t help out, you better get used to the look of white stone."]Youâ€™re gonna be seeing a whole lot more of it if someone tells Regigigas to let loose."<Listen, I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know a lot of things."sSo let me talk to Andris, our rangers, Helena, whoever else I can find. Weâ€™ll figure out how bad things are."PAnd if these thieves show their faces aboveground, you can brawl with them."~Theyâ€™ve got at least one Regi, probably more, so thereâ€™s a strong temptation to wreak havoc. Trust me â€“ Iâ€™d know."JHate to say it, but you just need to keep being your usual self, kid."JOr, no, I shouldnâ€™t call you kid. Take this â€“ youâ€™ve earned it."AUsed to give these to Chasm strike teams, for cave scouting."UItâ€™ll get you just about anywhere in the region â€“ nobody hides from you now."3So go get those badges and save the day, hero."Who are you?"Why are you doing this?"Shut up, edgelord."Who are they?"What do they want?"Why Yezera?"Not my problem."You wanted power?"You wanted money?"You

Itâ€™s your problem now, and I know you arenâ€™t gonna like that, but it is."5This is bigger than just one legendary PokÃ©mon."4Remember what I said about the big open secret?"oThe caves around Makya are tombs for the Regis. The weird ones I was talking about before. Ones like this."NWell, some archaeological teams went to study them a couple decades back."yAnd then they found the Regis, and the rich mineral veins, and the ruins, and they figured they could leverage that."{We got some corporate backing from Andris and Mavis, and boom: Team Chasm. I was one of those original archaeologists."nâ€¦Some of us. Helena wanted to run her own region. Andris wanted a piece of the organized crime bigtime."QMe, I study the Regis. And some people wanted me to leave well enough alone."jI had a Team and Regidrago on my side, and they didnâ€™t, so I got to study what I damn well pleased."LSome of us. I didnâ€™t. I had five Regis â€“ what did I need money for?"8If I wanted lab equipment, I sent a list to Helena."GI lived in a research station and ate ramen. Best days of my life."oI just wanted to study the Regis, and with their power, nobody could tell me no. Funny how that works out.")You make it sound so pure and noble."bI was curious. Wanted answers. I got them â€“ who could tell me no with Regidrago at my side?"YNot to mention the full might of Team Chasm, 'cause my research was VERY profitable."QIâ€™m getting to that, but also, hey, it could come in handy some day, yeah?"5As I was saying: we found the five lesser Regis."\It took me years, but I deciphered their inscriptions and understood their true nature."JThat led us to Regigigas, and at that point we were cooking with gas."RGigas was stronger than the rest of the Regis put together, and smarter, too."|Shape the earth, revert it back to some kind of primordial clay. Create seals and wards that nothing could get through."2And, yeah, it could throw a mean Giga Impact."iIt could doâ€¦ other things, too. We found a way to make it create ethereal PokÃ©mon with its power.";They were hostile, powerful â€“ had to be locked away."}And then by the time Yezera kicked down our door and told us to stop, she was basically just confirming what we already knew."pWe were playing with fire. If we kept using Regigigas, we ran the very real chance of destroying the world."`Or at least permanently changing it. So we put each Regi back in their tomb and went legit."iThe tombs were reinforced, of course â€“ just about nothing can get through the minor Regi chambers."KGigasâ€™s chamber can only be opened by the other five Regis together."_I donâ€™t know. She agreed with us: it was too dangerous. We were criminals, not lunatics."MI know thingsâ€¦ havenâ€™t been great for her, but this? This is insane."[Who knows. We knew some groups were trying to get them back â€“ they always have been."PBut succeeding? There was no way. Impossible. Butâ€¦ apparently Yezera can."*â€¦Probably. They might already have."nGigasâ€™s chamber is deep down, though, and if they havenâ€™t broken the seal yet, itâ€™d be for nothing."QOr if theyâ€™ve resealed it. I can try and scout it out, butâ€¦ no promises."^My POINT is that if you donâ€™t help out, you better get used to the look of white stone."]Youâ€™re gonna be seeing a whole lot more of it if someone tells Regigigas to let loose."<Listen, I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know a lot of things."sSo let me talk to Andris, our rangers, Helena, whoever else I can find. Weâ€™ll figure out how bad things are."PAnd if these thieves show their faces aboveground, you can brawl with them."~Theyâ€™ve got at least one Regi, probably more, so thereâ€™s a strong temptation to wreak havoc. Trust me â€“ Iâ€™d know."JHate to say it, but you just need to keep being your usual self, kid."JOr, no, I shouldnâ€™t call you kid. Take this â€“ youâ€™ve earned it."AUsed to give these to Chasm strike teams, for cave scouting."UItâ€™ll get you just about anywhere in the region â€“ nobody hides from you now."3So go get those badges and save the day, hero."Who are you?"Why are you doing this?"Shut up, edgelord."Who are they?"What do they want?"Why Yezera?"Not my problem."You wanted power?"You wanted money?"You wanted knowledge?"Why should I care?"Then why is Yezera..."How many Regis are stolen?"They're opening that door."Your point?0Iu; "[["gThe stove is covered with a light dusting of the powdered flavoring that comes with instant ramen."RA game console.

I want to ensure the most valuable things are kept for the longest."Youâ€™d be third-to-last."^Oh, if I could only wrap my arms around you and take you with me. All the way to the end." Thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m from, of course â€“ end of the line. You deserve better than that... but so do I, and Iâ€™d like to have one good child to keep me company."YOh, donâ€™t take it personally. Kids need to learn to grow up fast where Iâ€™m from."?Iâ€™ve made sure society is very... regimented. Practical."eWhen everythingâ€™s coming to a halt, you canâ€™t really afford the luxury of teenage rebellion."dIâ€™m a specter, \PN. My timeline is crumbling to ash. I donâ€™t know if it even really exists."Iâ€™ll either return there shortly, or cease to be. Give me this small mercy of being able to see my child again â€“ the child I wish Iâ€™d had."D...Our time is just about up. A word of advice: ditch the girl."5Sheâ€™s a liability, and sheâ€™ll drag you down."‡She doesnâ€™t deserve half the kindness sheâ€™s gotten, and the other half shouldâ€™ve been revoked to shape her into something better."}...What? Do you think I donâ€™t have my own Yezera? I said youâ€™d be third for a reason. Iâ€™m very proud of my second."–This oneâ€™s beyond repair, though. You deserve better than a girl thatâ€™d destroy the world over her social anxiety. Sheâ€™s quite literally insane."}Get rid of her and go back home to your Mavis. Sheâ€™ll love you even more now that youâ€™ve proven yourself so cleanly."Sheâ€™ll give you a role in life to fulfill, and protect you forever.

Regice, if you would."4Yo. Figureâ€™d, uh, yeah, that youâ€™d be here."bYezeraâ€™s here. You keep running into her. She, uh, doesnâ€™t really want to talk right now."0I got a job to do, but, uh, not keen on it." So you want to hear us out?"]Swear weâ€™ve got some good reasons. Even if Iâ€™m not that good at putting it in words."=Oh. Thatâ€™s good. Great. Honestly didnâ€™t expect that."HWell, I just figure weâ€™ve done a lot of ordering PokÃ©mon around.">Maybe itâ€™s time to even up the footing a bit, yâ€™know?"8We can all kinda make up for whatever we did wrong."mThe others have their reasons, but, uh, this is mine. Make a world where we can be forgiven. You get it?"(Well â€“ fine. You know what? Fine."bI donâ€™t need your permission, and we certainly donâ€™t need your help. Regice. Do â€˜em in."Zâ€¦You so sure? Takes a lot of pushing to train a team that strong in so little time."4But, yeah, no, I get it. Why would you help us?"?Rich brat. Maybe we can beat some responsibility into you."NUh. Donâ€™t really know how to break it to you. Youâ€¦ donâ€™t have time."EFor one, weâ€™ve already just about won. For two â€“ think fast!"(Regice, sweep â€˜em off their feet!"*Oh. Didnâ€™t, uh, really expect that.":Figured you were kind of a stuck-up brat. No offense."=Well, good. Maybe weâ€™ll be side by side one day, yeah?"5But, uh, for nowâ€¦ Iâ€™m supposed to fight you."HSo, uh, sorry â€“ ah, what am I saying, we live for this. Ready up."Yeah, I guess that tracks."#Fine. Thatâ€™sâ€¦ itâ€™s fine."5I came here to beat the crap out of you anyways."iOdds are Regice isnâ€™t gonna stick around much longer, so letâ€™s make it count. Try your best, eh?"-Well. Had to happen eventually, I guess."IIâ€™ve kinda sorta been planning what to say for the past few hours."cBut, umâ€¦ I still donâ€™t know. So can I just say what comes to mind and hope you understand?"BWelp. Listen, uh, Makyaâ€™s kinda in a weird place right now."]Team Chasm ran roughshod over this whole region and then kinda justâ€¦ got away with it?"So, uh, yeah, if you ever wanted proof that humans canâ€™t get even the most black-and-white justice right, there you are."KWouldâ€™ve been simple to fix that little screw-up. But they didnâ€™t."[So weâ€™re taking the power away from humans, and putting it in the hands of PokÃ©mon."Is it?

Ah-hah."LKinda got myself a bit worked up thereâ€¦ welp, no harm, no foul, yeah?"â€¦Nah, thatâ€™s stupid."^Iâ€™m not gonna waste this chance. Iâ€™ve got a Regi. Youâ€™re a prodigy.

Fine."Yâ€™know, fine, whatever."?You get what everyone else I fight gets. What you deserve."ARegice â€“ your service has ended. If you would go, then go."YSo it returns to its resting placeâ€¦ no matter. It has done all I desired and more."%As for you, we shall meet again."YWhen and where, fate shall decide, though I think I know where we shall settle this."8Do not pursue me. Your audience with Yezera awaits.""Seems Regiceâ€™s 'bout spent."ODidnâ€™t exactly expect them to be so squirrelly, but themâ€™s the breaks.".Figure itâ€™s headinâ€™ back to its home."eOne last thing, since you seem â€˜bout ready to see Yez again: you hurt her and Iâ€™ll find you."=And it wonâ€™t just be for some play fight with animals."sGâ€™evening, kid. Iâ€™ll be seeinâ€™ you. Keep in mind how nice it feels to be havinâ€™ all your bones intact."9Au revoir, Regice. Enjoy your entombment, I suppose."XAnd as for you, Iâ€™m breathless. Speechless. Youâ€™re even better than I imagined."OIf youâ€™d like to stop your pointless struggling against us, tell Yezera."4Weâ€™d love to have you.

Our victory comes soon."JYezera may be displeased in my performance, but she is understanding."GIn the end, this will make no difference. Thank you for your time."See ya, Regice."Ah, who am I kidding."cIf either of us is gonna see it again, itâ€™ll be you. Couldnâ€™t really hold a candle to you."UHad to try anyways, just for Yezera. And Iâ€™m gonna have to do it again, right?"VGood practice, I guess. Well, think about it â€“ everything, yâ€™know? Iâ€™m out."U*sigh* So long, Regice. You never really were my type, anyways, so head on home."HAnd as for YOU, well, next time we talk itâ€™ll be in a fair world!"MIf it isnâ€™t, then, uh, Iâ€™ll have to buy us a liâ€™l more time, 'kay?"FUntil then, Iâ€™ve got judgment to be a-judging.

It looks like a tough fight."yI knew you would seek Yezera. I am her humble servant, naturally, though I would rather keep my identity enshrouded."JPray excuse the charade â€“ it will not be necessary for much longer."jUnder Yezeraâ€™s profound guidance, we have achieved our goals. The titans have served their purpose."LI come then with a simple inquiry: will you not listen to my reasoning?"PThank you. Our goal is naught less than a complete reordering of the world."<My comrades have their own motives, but mine is simple."„The world at present is mercurial and deceptive. Human culture and technology serves as naught but a veil disguising ultimate truth."uOnly the realm of ancient myth, tended by gods, untouched by humans, might let us perceive it. Do you not agree?"tHow disappointing, to dismiss it outright. If you have no eye for truth, then we have nothing else to speak of."_Forgive me this act of passion, but I expect a titanâ€™s wrath may settle my raging heart."Regice, heed my command."RTo the contrary: it has adamant support, if only one ruminates on the matter."`Such wavering faith is nigh-useless for my purposes, alas. We require unflinching devotion."_*sigh* I would be forsaking my duty if I did not stall you at the least. Prepare yourself."lI should encourage you to do so.

That is intolerable to us."UThis shall be no decisive victory of mine, but I cannot let you pass unhindered."/â€¦I should very much like to believe you."`If you speak truth, then I bid you repeat your convictions to Yezera herself next you meet."oShe can see the machinations of your heart more clearly than I. Until then, you remain a trainer, as do I."<My enemy I smite, my ally I train. To either, en garde."LIf you will not listen to my entreaties, then you are beyond salvation."VAlas.

Take it from someone who knows, kid: you ainâ€™t even scratched the surface."AI can make you plenty more miserable if I set my mind to it."zBut, cheer up, kid. Iâ€™m 'bout to give ya what you always want: a good fight. Facing a Regi oughta cheer ya up. Heh."RNah, I ainâ€™t about to trust that.

Tell it to Yezera."rFor now, I ainâ€™t too keen on letting you off easy. Sorry. Beating folks into the dirt is my job, after all."CAh, well.

They ainâ€™t never been happy with my way of goinâ€™ about covert ops."@Too rough 'nd tumble. I ainâ€™t built for cloak-and-dagger."iSo, let me tell you straight: you listen to Yezera. You hear her out. And donâ€™t you dare hurt her."KAll I ask. And, uh, I wasnâ€™t just sent here to chit-chat. You ready?"Oh, hello."RSuch a picturesque place to meet. If only it were under better circumstances."]Regice and I have unfortunately been told to make sure Yezera has no unwelcome visitors."xBefore that, thoughâ€¦ I know youâ€™re more than a pretty face. Youâ€™ve got a spark to you. Will you listen to me?"0Aww. I knew I had a good feeling about you."[How do I explain itâ€¦ well, I hate to use the word, but modern society is degenerate."_Weâ€™re distant from the perfect moment of creation. Weâ€™ve kind of taken over the world."UNo respect for our elders â€“ the primordial PokÃ©mon that created the universe."zYezeraâ€™s going to reset this world back to its origins. And then humanity will be in the bosom of Arceus once more."kDonâ€™t call me insane. Although Iâ€™m sure this arrogant, faithless civilization would use that term."QIâ€™m merely devout, and devotion means making sacrifices. For example: you."EI really do like you, butâ€¦ we all have to sacrifice sometimes."MGodlike PokÃ©mon are now treated as not much more than beasts of burden."MAvatars are destroyed at will because theyâ€™re â€œthreats to humans.â€"\The world has lost all respect, the divine essence from creation diluted and destroyed."NAnd since you seem to be no different, I can take some joy in this fight."‰Arceus created the world. It is pure, and perfect, and resetting the world back to its original form will let us be pure and perfect too."BIâ€™d like to see myself blessed by the grace of our creator.")Iâ€™d like to see you that way, too."In time."@For now, Iâ€™ve been ordered to remove you. Shall we dance?")Good. I knew I saw something in you."BSome spark of faith. Iâ€™m aâ€¦ very good judge of character."ˆIâ€™d love to just talk with you for a while, but I was explicitly instructed to stop you. So weâ€™ll fight. Donâ€™t take it personally."Oh. Was I too forward?"HMy emotions tend to get the better of me. Iâ€™m almost heartbroken."%Well, I suppose I am a stranger."€Fortunately, Iâ€™ve been sent to ensure you make it no farther, so I have a convenient vent for all these feelings of rejection.".Hello, friend. Yezera wishes to be alone."NTo that end, I have been sent, and graciously afforded a titan to aid me."`Before we attend to your removal, however, may I interest you in a short, frank discussion?"RI would rather like to try to convince you of the legitimacy of our position."Thank you for your time."_Yezeraâ€™s goal is to recreate the conditions of the world shortly following its creation."oModern science has attained almost complete understanding and mastery over the world â€“ the modern world."It cannot, however, understand the past. By reverting existence, we may study the universe from its conception and obtain universal knowledge."#This is the only way to do so."vWithout the reversion, humanity will never attain complete understanding of the universe. It is worth all prices."PNow our time for conversation is up, however. Regice, please do the honors."AAll persons who attempt to advance civilization should care."HUniversal knowledge is a prerequisite for an all- powerful society."\That is my goal. That is the goal of all science: to know, and to apply that knowledge."\Your ignorance implies discussion will get us nowhere. Let us dispense with such, then."<Knowledge will be retained into the new primordial era."8We can rebuild at least small enclaves of humanity."\From there our analysis and conquest will begin: a new society with absolute knowledge."@And, stemming from this absolute knowledge, absolute power."YConsider it. In the mean time, there is the business I mentioned earlier. Excuse me."|I am glad you have the wisdom to agree. If you should wish to support us in our endeavors, I will be happy to have you."xWe will fight for a more enlightened era. For now, however, I must slow you. Business is business. Let us commence."II find this highly unfortunate. You will be left behind by progress."NIf you would prefer to retain your ignorance, however, I cannot help you.",Prepare yourself. Regice, if you would."4Yo. Figureâ€™d, uh, yeah, that youâ€™d be here."bYezeraâ€™s here. You keep running into her. She, uh, doesnâ€™t really want to talk right now."0I got a job to do, but, uh, not keen on it." So you want to hear us out?"]Swear weâ€™ve got some good reasons.

Honestly didnâ€™t expect that."HWell, I just figure weâ€™ve done a lot of ordering PokÃ©mon around.">Maybe itâ€™s time to even up the footing a bit, yâ€™know?"8We can all kinda make up for whatever we did wrong."mThe others have their reasons, but, uh, this is mine.

Thatâ€™sâ€¦ itâ€™s fine."5I came here to beat the crap out of you anyways."iOdds are Regice isnâ€™t gonna stick around much longer, so letâ€™s make it count. Try your best, eh?"-Well. Had to happen eventually, I guess."IIâ€™ve kinda sorta been planning what to say for the past few hours."cBut, umâ€¦ I still donâ€™t know. So can I just say what comes to mind and hope you understand?"BWelp. Listen, uh, Makyaâ€™s kinda in a weird place right now."]Team Chasm ran roughshod over this whole region and then kinda justâ€¦ got away with it?"So, uh, yeah, if you ever wanted proof that humans canâ€™t get even the most black-and-white justice right, there you are."KWouldâ€™ve been simple to fix that little screw-up. But they didnâ€™t."[So weâ€™re taking the power away from humans, and putting it in the hands of PokÃ©mon."Is it? Is it!"AAm I insane for wanting some damn PUNISHMENT in this world?!"DWell, guess what. If people wonâ€™t give me it, Iâ€™ll MAKE it.""And Iâ€™ve got just the tool!"%It is simple, you â€“ you idiot!"aI can track down every ex-Chasm criminal and haul them up to the courts myself if I have to!"UThey just wonâ€™t do anything if I did!

Fine."Yâ€™know, fine, whatever."?You get what everyone else I fight gets. What you deserve."ARegice â€“ your service has ended.

It has done all I desired and more."%As for you, we shall meet again."YWhen and where, fate shall decide, though I think I know where we shall settle this."8Do not pursue me. Your audience with Yezera awaits.""Seems Regiceâ€™s 'bout spent."ODidnâ€™t exactly expect them to be so squirrelly, but themâ€™s the breaks.".Figure itâ€™s headinâ€™ back to its home."eOne last thing, since you seem â€˜bout ready to see Yez again: you hurt her and Iâ€™ll find you."=And it wonâ€™t just be for some play fight with animals."sGâ€™evening, kid.

Great job."PAs your brother, goodbye. Iâ€™m not gonna see you again for a little while."fIâ€™m blocking Mavis on everything, picking a direction, and walking until I find something cool.""Thanks. Good luck to you too."SIâ€™d stay, but Iâ€™ve got faith youâ€™ve got this whole fiasco under control."7Gonna get a headstart on finding inner peace. Hah."Donâ€™t flatter me.">Itâ€™s irresponsible... but, yeah, I need some time away."*I hope you can do the same, honestly."HGet away from Mavis, from the gyms, everything. Itâ€™d do you good."!Canâ€™t change my mind, kid."YScrew Mavis. Screw the company. Screw the gyms, screw the Championship, screw Makya."Gonna go find out what Iâ€™m actually interested in, 'stead of just trying to one-up you for mommy. But thanks for the concern."Donâ€™t. Seriously."yI know sheâ€™s our mom, but sheâ€™s the reason weâ€™ve been at each otherâ€™s throats. Or, uh, Iâ€™ve been at yours."hIâ€™m getting away from her. She wants to talk, she can start by not pitting us against each other."#â€¦It is what it is, you know?"<You need me, you call, alright? Iâ€™ll pick up for you."HCongratulations, Champion. Love ya. Go be a hero and kick some ass."CI had assumed we'd meet later in the Tournament, to be honest."VOh well, no use worrying about the seeding now. Just need to focus on the battle." I'm going all in. Be ready."RHmm, a disappointing result. Seems like I won't be the first repeat champion."LBest of luck, it'll feel better to lose to the person who takes it all."&How d'ya do? Surprised to see me?">Well, I ainâ€™t 'bout to let this opportunity pass me up."eDonâ€™t much matter to me if the worldâ€™s endin'. Câ€™mon. Letâ€™s have us a grand olâ€™ fight."How d'ya do? \PN?"0Heard a lot 'bout you. The nameâ€™s Alessa."nIâ€™m aâ€¦ call me an old friend of Yezeraâ€™s. Real interested to see if youâ€™re as good as she claims."Ya ready?"dAinâ€™t too surprised â€˜bout that one. I tried my best, honest, but I ainâ€™t your rival. Heh."ROughta leave you to Yez. Ah, well, I figure I might get a second shot at you."1Weâ€™ll see, huh? Iâ€™ll be watchinâ€™, kid."So y'are good, aren'tcha?"MYezera ainâ€™t much of a liar, but I figured maybe she got a li'l rusty."bQuite a team, kid. And quite a trainer they got. Iâ€™ll be watchin', kid. Iâ€™ll be watchin'."Good day."3Did you not expect the Dreadnaught to be here?"sIâ€™ve competed in every Championship since their inception. I wasnâ€™t about to miss this one, avatars or no."'I want to face you. And now I can."tIt brings a smile to my faceâ€¦ though now that must be snuffed out, and my mind setâ€¦ on the fight to comeâ€¦"Zâ€¦Hmm. I lost. I donâ€™t know why I expected to win so shortly after our last match."KAh well! It was fun while it lasted, and it was good to see you again."}In a way, Iâ€™m glad I lost so decisively. If Iâ€™d become Champion, the hassle of dealing with the gym would be a nightmare!"RGoodbye, \PN. Come talk to me again sometime, though. My door is always open."mOh, hey. I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d get this far. I didnâ€™t think â€“ well, didnâ€™t think a lot of things."@Doesnâ€™t matter now. Win or lose, Iâ€™m ready to face you."HAnd, uh, Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing you give 100%. Letâ€™s go."/Yo. Iâ€™m Eifion. Youâ€™re, uh, \PN, yeah?"YThe kid whoâ€™s been running errands for Tamarind? Heard youâ€™re, uh, pretty scary."QAbout half the trainers I talk to have lost to you at some point or another."2... I, uh, donâ€™t plan on being one of them."
Damn!">I â€“ I gave my best. My team did too. All I can ask for."hYou too, you know? Youâ€™re doing great. Really impressive. Iâ€™ll, uh, Iâ€™ll try again next year."@If there is one next year. Gonna be rooting for you anyhow."KHuh. Well, I see why youâ€™ve got so many notches on your PokÃ© Balls."wSomebodyâ€™s gonna humble you one day. Looking forward to seeing that â€“ but Iâ€™m gonna root for you until then."[I like an underdog story, but I also like betting on the winning horse. Gâ€™luck, \PN."RFigured Iâ€™d be seeinâ€™ you again. Itâ€™s been a little while, hasnâ€™t it?"VSeems like just yesterday you were showing up and showing down with me on Casaba."6Iâ€™m not about to go down so easy a second time."You ready? I am."=Heh. Guess I never shouldâ€™ve figured I could beat you."$Iâ€™ll be rooting for you, kid."GShouldnâ€™t call you kid, I guess. Barely recognize you, honestly."5Good luck. Even though I doubt youâ€™ll need it."3Oh, well, look what the Shinx dragged in. \PN."LEight years ago, I lost to Yezera, and because of that Team Chasm fell."sIâ€™ve been training since then. Iâ€™m planning on redeeming myself among the scattered remnants of your team."rNothing personal â€“ I actually rather appreciate you. Youâ€™re just the most convenient point of comparison."MNow, letâ€™s see if I canâ€™t snuff out this childâ€™s hopes and dreams."k*sigh* Iâ€™ll need to see my dentist. I think I lost an inch of enamel to grinding my teeth that hard."DWhat is it about you that makes you so infuriatingly adaptable?"FFine. Fine! Iâ€™ll resign myself to the only thing Iâ€™m good at."|Iâ€™ll turn this region into an economic powerhouse, become even richer than Mavis, and buy LuxTech out from under her."^Enjoy my petty revenge. And good luck with the Championship or whatever. Iâ€™m done here."$Hello! Hale and hearty, I hope?"{Oh, rest easy, I have no interest in the title.

Iâ€™ve been waiting for this fight."PYou would not BELIEVE the time I put into training after you got our badge!"~If youâ€™re thinking Iâ€™m just another rando, think again.

Wow!"GThat wasâ€¦ uhâ€¦ yeah! Still got a long ways to go, I guess! Wow!"†Iâ€™ll remember that one for a long time to come, lemme tell you.

I'll be right here, if the desire strikes you."%I even tweaked my team a little!"FChampion, eh? I hope you don't feel above battling little 'ol me.";Wait. If I beat you now, do I become champion instead?"1That was a champion-tier victory, all right!"aIf you still feel the need to prove yourself, the previous champions are all still in Makya."'Fighting them would be fun, I bet!"„I avoided worrying about the Avatar Crisis during my gym challlenge.

I take my leave."%Awww, kid, you shouldnâ€™t have."xGoinâ€™ all-out? On yours truly? Iâ€™m touched. Not even half-honest, either â€“ itâ€™s a treat seeinâ€™ you fight."~Go on. Yez is waitinâ€™ for you. I ainâ€™t too hung up on this whole scheme. Yezâ€™ll turn out fine either way â€“ tough girl."RTougher than me, I swear.

All she had to do was not tell you."}She had to not be human. Her one redeeming quality: her inhumanity. And now she went and betrayed that, and with it, me."0Apparently. Itâ€™s sickening, to be honest."tThe same shallow, stupid desires as everyone else. I guess Iâ€™m just as much of an idiot for believing in her."Yes. Good. For. Her."fUnfortunately, it isnâ€™t so good for her grand plan, nor mine. I hope the catharsis is worth it."5Yes, she did. Iâ€™m glad youâ€™ve realized that."(Fine.

Iâ€™ll fail â€“ Iâ€™ll gladly fail â€“ but Iâ€™m not about to give up. Iâ€™ve got friends that need protecting."cIâ€™ve got stuff in my past I need to make up for. And Iâ€™ve got a world that needs building."A better one â€“ one thatâ€™s more equal, more fair. Sorry it isnâ€™t what you want, but I wonâ€™t just roll over for you."You ready?"%...Hey. So, uh, this is it, huh?"]Youâ€™re, like, not gonna have a change of mind? No justice? No fairness? No punishment?"~Oh, who am I kidding â€“ youâ€™re Tamarindâ€™s lapdog. Youâ€™ve been doing her dirty work since, like, literally day one!"8Guess what that means! Thatâ€™s right: time to pay!"zThatâ€™s what they all said. Youâ€™re not a team grunt! Youâ€™re just, like, a temporarily inconvenienced mastermind!"dUgh, youâ€™re all the same. Well, Iâ€™ve chewed through a lotta grunts. No different this time!"'Nope! But I really really want to!"zTamarindâ€™s out of my reach, but youâ€™re, like, the second-best thing. So câ€™mere so I can give you a bloody nose."7If you were sorry youâ€™d stop fighting me, idiot!"Youâ€™re such a â€“ such a dolt! How can I get it through your thick skull that youâ€™re the bad guy? Can I beat it into you? Wanna find out?"ˆOh, I swear, Iâ€™ll roll up these sleeves and deck you myself if I have to! I swear, if you chip my nails Iâ€™m gonna kill you for real!"=Câ€™mon, boys and girls! Weâ€™ve got a beatdown to give!"Ah. Hah. Hahaha!"}So be it! My reading is complete â€“ the scars of this battle left in the ancient stone here are a portent of things to come."TCan you suppose what it says? It says I shall lose here, and you shall triumph.".Hah! Fate has a sense of humor, it seems."`Go on. Continue yet deeper. I know my place, and will not stand against destiny any longer."qFor my sanity, I will refrain from attempting to divine the results of your future battles. I take my leave."%Awww, kid, you shouldnâ€™t have."xGoinâ€™ all-out? On yours truly? Iâ€™m touched. Not even half-honest, either â€“ itâ€™s a treat seeinâ€™ you fight."~Go on. Yez is waitinâ€™ for you. I ainâ€™t too hung up on this whole scheme. Yezâ€™ll turn out fine either way â€“ tough girl."RTougher than me, I swear. So you go do what ya got planned, whatever that is."WIf ya hurt her, theyâ€™ll never find the body, blah blah blah, you know the drill."AGood luck, kid. Come find me some time afterwards, yâ€™hear?"0...Go. Leave. Now, before I lose my temper."dIs that really what the fate of the universe hangs on? Our relative skill in training PokÃ©mon?"fItâ€™s ridiculous! Itâ€™s idiotic! I canâ€™t believe â€“ go! Just go! I should... I should... go."~Noted. Excuse me â€“ I fear I may not have provided adequate resistance. I now find myself lacking any means to challenge you."m...Understood. I have no recourse but to retreat. I wish you the worst of luck in your future endeavors."KIf you will permit me to leave, I will no longer impede your progress."4Goodbye, friend. I hope never to see you again."Damn it. Damn it!"UI â€“ yeah, thatâ€™s how it goes. Never was as good as you. Any of you hotshots."gPushed my PokÃ©mon hard to try and get there, and now look at me. Trying to make up for all of it.":Sorry, everyone. Sorry, Manaphy. I guess that was it."VLetâ€™s get yâ€™all back to a PokÃ©center, OK? Get you fixed up... Iâ€™m sorry..."AUgh! Iâ€™m â€“ fine! Ow. I think I took a stray shot... oof."ƒLook me in the damn eyes, you dumb grunt! If I was â€“ ow â€“ if I wasnâ€™t... if I wasnâ€™t...

You stupid, stupid dolt..."{But youâ€™re pickinâ€™ a fight with Yez, so Iâ€™m gonna leave you with some bruises. You 'bout ready? Put 'em up, kid."]You want to get to her, ya go through me. Call me clichÃ© but thatâ€™s my line about it.")I shouldâ€™ve known she was useless."jYezera was THIS close. So close to getting everything she wanted. All she had to do was not tell you."}She had to not be human. Her one redeeming quality: her inhumanity. And now she went and betrayed that, and with it, me."0Apparently. Itâ€™s sickening, to be honest."tThe same shallow, stupid desires as everyone else. I guess Iâ€™m just as much of an idiot for believing in her."Yes. Good. For. Her."fUnfortunately, it isnâ€™t so good for her grand plan, nor mine. I hope the catharsis is worth it."5Yes, she did. Iâ€™m glad youâ€™ve realized that."(Fine. I hope I never see you again."HBut, well, Iâ€™ll take care of her once the regression is complete.";You, on the other hand, Iâ€™ll deal with now.

You want me to explain this? Velenz? *shrug*">Oh, I know. But youâ€™re the one standing in front of me."LCute. Never shouldâ€™ve brought a hero here. Heroes are always trouble.")*snort* Sure, kid. Whatever you say."vI know youâ€™re here with that girl â€“ Candy? Helenaâ€™s had her trackers keeping an eye on her for a while now."JShe hasnâ€™t been causing too much trouble, though, so we let her go."dListen, we ran this region. Do you know what that means â€“ taken any political science lately?"JIt means a monopoly on violence. Every government works the same way."BOh, you can call me a tyrant if you want, but Iâ€™m no thief."Yep! And a damn good one."fNot an absolute one, though â€“ Andris and Helena made up the other two corners of that triangle."JNot to mention the extensive bureaucracy of Team Chasm at its height."@From who? This was a lawless frontier before we came along."VOnly holdouts like Novo truly resisted unification into the larger establishment."hThe benefits of being a tyrant. If people are getting in the way, you can convince them to... stop."/Câ€™mon. You were raised better than that."8We still rule the region because we ARE the region."Weâ€™ve got old grunts everywhere whoâ€™ll still follow orders if I give them. Helena has her trackers, so weâ€™ve got an intelligence agency."dAnd sheâ€™s got her claws in LuxTechâ€™s outpost here, so economic development is guided by us."XWe were a big organization. All-encompassing. And we had to be: lots of work to do."uOver just a few decades, we imposed law on this place, created entire new settlements, made it rich and vibrant."ƒWe quintupled the population. We dealt with outbreaks, infighting, earthquakes. We secured the support of multiple major companies."~And at the end of the day, we managed to go legit, integrate with the Prizcan government, and arenâ€™t even hated for it."_If you want to try and do even a tenth of that without resorting to violence, be my guest."‹We punished people, which youâ€™d call assault. We imprisoned them, which youâ€™d call kidnapping. We taxed them, which youâ€™d call theft."FOh, sure, people resisted us, but we only acted how a state does."ECandyâ€™s too young to have been around during Chasmâ€™s zenith."~Sheâ€™s got a childâ€™s notion of justice, and she thinks that performing her own little acts of violence fixes anything."GMaybe she should ask herself why almost everyoneâ€™s fine with us."	Yes."Andris did it for money."Helena did it for power."WAnd I did it so I could finally have the resources to properly research the Regis."ZEveryone in Team Chasm â€“ in any organization â€“ has their own reasons to be there."F...We can argue all day, kid. Youâ€™re not going to get anywhere."Let me put it this way:"’a lot of the PokÃ©mon Candy has â€œrescuedâ€ were given to Chasm grunts for combat purposes, but they ended up liking their new home plenty fine."PMaybe talking things out wouldâ€™ve resolved things better than theft, huh?"gBut I know you want to know. Whatâ€™s up with Velenz? Well, itâ€™s simple. We were trying to work."I canâ€™t work when Iâ€™m being attacked by wannabe heroes. When the power grid is being fried. When Ghost-types are being sent to haunt my lab.";We asked, repeatedly, for them to stop. They didnâ€™t."tSo I took Regigigas and had it carve up the bedrock around here, then dragged some avatars in for good measure."zThey couldnâ€™t prove it was us, but pretty soon they lost their base of operations, and that got the message across."LYes. Was. If theyâ€™d wanted to keep it, they couldâ€™ve left us alone."?Kid, have you ever gotten twelve hours of sleep in a week?"vThese â€œfreedom fightersâ€ were using every trick in the book. Constantly harrying us. Never a momentâ€™s rest.".Ugh. Makes me mad just thinking about it."I think so, yeah."NThatâ€™s how it goes. Warfare ainâ€™t pretty, but it exists for a reason."qI did what I did. And if someone wants to â€œbring me to justiceâ€ for it, I say: what does that even mean?"LIâ€™m breaking my back running this region, making it better every day."fYou want to throw me in prison? Make this place worse so you can have your petty revenge? Idiocy."SI know what I did, and Iâ€™m not going to do it again. Neither is anyone else."|...Now, kid.

You want a hug?"Aww, kid. Damn..."4*hiss* Sorry. You two are too cute not to join."^\PN, I promise weâ€™re gonna take care of you from now on whether you like it or not, OK?"xZain and I have been talking about you and Mavis and everything and... yeah. Weâ€™re gonna adopt you if we have to."uWell, thatâ€™s moving a little fast... but, yeah. What she means to say is that I want to make things up to you."(And that means being there for you."zSo, yâ€™know, if things donâ€™t work out with Mavis and you need someone... weâ€™re your family. If youâ€™ll have us."	Hah!"-Donâ€™t worry, I get it. I deserve that."JBut, uh, listen, kid: if you need me, Iâ€™m here. Same goes for ZoÃ©."XIf things donâ€™t work out with Mavis, weâ€™ll be your family. If youâ€™ll have us."'You never gotta be alone. Alright?"UOf course. Youâ€™re welcome, kiddo. Champion. \PN. Whatever youâ€™re called now."\I canâ€™t promise much, but Iâ€™ll be there for you. Things are gonna be different now."GLove you too.

Great work!"˜I am absolutely STOKED that you got an actual ceremony. I sent Tamarind five letters telling her how disappointed I was that the whole thing got ruined!"oI, uh, also tried to see if ZoÃ© would show up, but sheâ€™s still gone. Starting to get worried about her."/But thatâ€™s a me problem! You just relax!"Hello, \PN."{The importance of the Champion title is lost on me, but I received an invitation, and had no intention of refusing it."^Consider this minor show of moral support repayment for your assistance. Congratulations."GHey! Lookinâ€™ pretty good. Sorry this took so long to get set up."~We were supposed to get you officially coronated as Champion right after the tournament, but then there was The Incident."wAnd since it takes eight billion years to get anything through bureaucracy limbo here, itâ€™s... how late is this?""Three months? Two and a half?"DOh, and we only have thirty minutes, so letâ€™s keep it moving."iThanks. Canâ€™t help but notice you didnâ€™t say I was lookinâ€™ good... but thatâ€™s fair, I guess."kFor one, Iâ€™m like twenty-five years older than you.

You know me well enough to know Iâ€™m not gonna."TIâ€™ve had enough on my plate without trying to set up your little victory lap."Youâ€™re very welcome."TAt least someone appreciates the monumental effort I put into this damn region."]You know how hard it is to get even a single person in a room for half an hour in Makya?"AEveryoneâ€™s always scheming or brooding or committing sins."@But like I said, weâ€™re on a timer, so letâ€™s get moving."nI know certain individuals who will remain unnamed will have their eyes on their watches the entire time."uHonestly I canâ€™t believe the stars aligned to get everyone I needed in one place for this long. Minor miracle."%Anyways! Letâ€™s go, letâ€™s go!"0Howdy. Hope you ainâ€™t feelinâ€™ stood up."]I plan on buyin' you a drink, never you worry. Just ain't been feelin' it with Yez gone." Part of my mind just ainâ€™t in the here and now. Figured Iâ€™d show up for this, at least. Iâ€™ve been thinkinâ€™ 'bout you more than Iâ€™d like to admit. Hah!"cDonâ€™tcha go givinâ€™ me that look. Go on. Git. Weâ€™ll have time enough for chit-chat later."Hah. Damn kid..."&Hmph. Nice to see you doing well."}It was only a walk to get here, and I needed an excuse to get out anyways. I donâ€™t really keep up with current events."BGuess you did pretty well, though. That tracks. I can see it."3Takes a lot to impress me. You do. Keep at it."ƒThereâ€™s a Ditto in attendance. It roils amicably, seemingly glad that its mythical counterpart is taking the attention off of it."gThereâ€™s a letter on the table. The paper smells faintly of perfume, and you know itâ€™s for you."Râ€œCongratulations. You deserve this. Youâ€™re this regionâ€™s gleaming star."LMake them respect you. Make them worship you. They donâ€™t deserve you."gPlease accept my utmost apologies for not being able to attend. I still have matters to attend to."gLoose ends to be wrapped up â€“ or severed. Weâ€™ll be together soon, and then never parted again."Ever yours, S.â€"eHats off to you, champ. The moment you first beat me, I knew you were in this for the long haul."FIf only I knew how right I was. I wouldâ€™ve made some bets! Hah!"It gleams up at you with pinpoint eyes. Youâ€™re sure in its head itâ€™s making a joke about you, but not at your expense."oAh, my dear \PN. Iâ€™ve been watching your ascendance with prying eyes ever since I eloped unto the night."ZYou show such grace and strength! No one could be disappointed with your performance."<But thereâ€™s someone you wish was here, isnâ€™t there?"^Never fear! A late entrance is a dramatic entrance, wouldnâ€™t you agree, darling? Ahaha!".Hey, Champion! Didnâ€™t expect to see me?"rIâ€™ve been, like, superglued to Tammyâ€™s side the past few months. Couldnâ€™t get away even if I wanted to."]But, like, I wouldnâ€™t miss it for the world, dummy! Love ya way too much to miss this!"pYour suffering has reached its end! The long, arduous climb has culminated with you at the zenith of Makya!"JI hope beyond hope that my tempering has contributed to your victory."XNow that role belongs to you! Test all challengers! Test them with fury and frenzy!"NThereâ€™s a Mew in attendance. Nobody seems to know what to make of that."„Personally, the Mew seems to be exulting in being an enigma. It also seems rather proud of you, and its similarly-mutable companion."(Oh, \PN, Iâ€™m so happy to see you!"aYou deserve to have your victory celebrated. Youâ€™ve done so much for all of us. Thank you."kNow go enjoy your time in the spotlight â€“ even if this ceremony is a little smaller than Iâ€™d like."One sec."Yeah, I'm ready."

Start battles with healthy PokÃ©mon."Team Size"–You can have a maximum of 6 PokÃ©mon with you at any time. This is known as your 'Team'. You can store extra PokÃ©mon using the PC in any PokÃ©Center."Levels"©Each PokÃ©mon has a level from 1 to 70. A PokÃ©mon's level determines its stats as well as what moves it could learn. Reaching high enough levels also unlocks Evolution."Types are strong or weak against other types. Having a variety of different types on your team helps you take advantage of these relationships."Healing your PokÃ©mon"yHeal your PokÃ©mon at PokÃ©Centers between battles. You can often use the Aid Kit instead to save on traveling time."Who goes first?"‰In battle, the PokÃ©mon with the higher speed stat gets to use their move first. Some moves modify this. Speed ties are decided randomly."Attacking vs Status"~Attacking moves deal damage. Status moves do not. Status moves are notated by a Yin/Yang symbol (White and Black intermixing)."Physical vs Special"¤Attacking moves are split into Physical moves, and Special moves. Each of these categories uses different stats to determine how much damage is dealt to the target."Physical Moves"¥Physical moves are notated by the symbol of a smashing fist. Their damage is based on the Attack (Atk) stat of the attacker and the Defense (Def) stat of the target."Special Moves"«Special moves are notated by the symbol of a splash. Their damage is based on the Special Attack (Sp. Atk) of the attacker and the Special Defense (Sp. Def) of the target."Targeting"µMost moves target only a single PokÃ©mon, but many can target multiple PokÃ©mon at once. Some moves differ in how far they can target in the bigger battle styles (doubles, triples)."Move Types"£Every move has a type. Attacking moves deal different amounts of damage to different PokÃ©mon based on those PokÃ©mon's types. This is called 'type effectiveness'."Same-Type Bonus"šPokÃ©mon deal 50% more damage with moves the share a type with them. For example, a Raichu deals 50% more damage with an Electric move than a Normal move."Learning Moves"ŠPokÃ©mon learn new moves as they level up. They can also learn moves from the 'Move Tutors' who sit in the left side of every PokÃ©Center."Base Power"Moves with higher Base Power deal more damage. Some moves deal variable Base Power depending on the situation. Status moves have no base power."–Accuracy is a move's chance of hitting. Most moves have 100% accuracy. Some effects can raise accuracy to let you use low-accuracy moves consistently."Power Points"ŠPower Points, or PP, is a number which limits how many times a move can be used. Healing at a PokÃ©Center or with the Aid Kit restores PP."—Each PokÃ©mon has type weakness and type resistances based on its own type. eg. Water deals double damage to Fire, and Fire deals half damage to Water."Type Combinations"±When a PokÃ©mon has two types, its type weaknesses and resistances multiply. A PokÃ©mon can be double weak or double resistant, or immune even though one of their types is weak."Normal Effective"SNormal Effective is the default effectiveness of all moves against a PokÃ©mon."Super Effective"USuper Effective moves deal double the damage compared to normal effective moves."Hyper Effective"ŠHyper Effective moves deal quadruple the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a PokÃ©mon is double weak to a type."Not Very Effective"VNot Very Effective moves deal half the damage compared to normal effective moves."Barely Effective"’Barely Effective moves deal one quarter the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a PokÃ©mon is double resistant to a type."Ineffective"¯Ineffective moves deal no damage at all. This can happen if one of a PokÃ©mon's types has an immunity to the attacking move type, even if the other is neutral (or even weak!)."Looking Up Matchups"‘The 5th and 6th pages of a MasterDex entry show that PokÃ©mon's type matchups. Open the MasterDex in battle to check matchups if you're not sure."Psychic vs Steel"PPsychic is now Super-Effective vs Steel.

Ice is Super-Effective against those types, so it's only natural!"Other changes"`Rock resists Ice. Fairy resists Dragon. Fairy is neutral against Fire. Bug resists Psychic."Why Get More?"Having choices of PokÃ©mon is important when facing challenges. A team of six is a bare minimum--it's best to catch more and pull them from the PC as needed."Methods of Aquiring"‹The two main methods of acquiring PokÃ©mon are catching them from the wild, and receiving them from other Trainers through gifts or trades."Catching Basics"®Wild PokÃ©mon will attack you if you walk through patches of grass, dark ground in caves, or other wild terrain. You can catch these PokÃ©mon by throwing PokÃ© Balls at them." Increase Catch Chance pt. 1"›Catching a PokÃ©mon isn't guaranteed. It's easier to catch PokÃ©mon when their health has been lowered by your attacks, or when they have a status ailment." Increase Catch Chance pt. 2"±Every time a PokÃ©mon breaks out of a ball, it'll be slightly easier to catch for the rest of the battle. You can check what your current catch chance is in the PokÃ© Ball menu."Finding Wild PokÃ©mon"ªUse the DexNav to get information on which PokÃ©mon are available where you are. You can also use it to find more PokÃ©mon of a species that you've already caught one of."Trades"Throughout the world there will be people offering trades for PokÃ©mon. Usually they want a different PokÃ©mon, but sometimes they want money."What are Stats?"gStats, short for Statistics, are the numbers which determine how your PokÃ©mon performs in battle."Checking Stats"ŠCheck your PokÃ©mon's stats by looking at the second page of their summary screen, accessible through the PokÃ©mon menu in the pause menu."Stat Factors"˜Your PokÃ©mon's stats are calculated from a combination of their species' 'Base Stats', their own 'Style Points', and extra modifications during battle."Base Stats"­Every species of PokÃ©mon have base stats, which affect every PokÃ©mon of that species. e.g. Every Raichu will be fast because the Raichu species has a high Speed base stat."Style Points"”Style Points are numbers which you can customize to change your PokÃ©mon's stats. Style Points show as blue numbers on the stat page of the summary."Leveling and Evolution"…Your PokÃ©mon's stats will increase every time they level up. When PokÃ©mon evolve, their stats change (almost always they increase)."Accuracy and Evasion"Accuracy and Evasion are two stats which are only active in battle, starting at 100% each. They are only modified by in-battle changing effects."Stat Steps"“Effects can modify a PokÃ©mon's stats during battle. These are called 'stat steps'. Stat steps multiply or divide the PokÃ©mon's listed stat value."Bounds of Stat Steps"Stat steps start at 0, and can increase up to +12 (4x) and down to -12 (.25x). Stat steps are reset if you swap the PokÃ©mon out or it faints."Checking Stat Steps"œYou can check the current stat steps of each PokÃ©mon on the battlefield using the Info button. It lists the numerical step as well as resultant multiplier."What are abilities?"Abilities are special powers that PokÃ©mon can have based on their species. Most PokÃ©mon can have one of 2 possible abilities."Ability Effects"‹Abilities do a wide variety of different things. Understanding your team's abilities, and choosing the right ones, is important to winning."Checking Abilities"‹Check your PokÃ©mon's summary to see what ability they have. Use the MasterDex to read about the abilities of enemy PokÃ©mon during battle."Choosing Abilities"A PokÃ©mon's ability is one of the two its species can have, randomly chosen when you get it. You can use Ability Capsules to swap to the other."Conditional Abilities"ƒMany abilities only do things under certain circumstances. Building around Weather and Room-synergy abilities is a common strategy."Effect Of Evolution"{A PokÃ©mon's ability tends to stay the same when evolving, but can change. When this happens, the game will alert you."Defeating Abilities"ƒAn enemy Trainer's ability too much? Abilities like Neutralizing Gas, and moves like Gastro Acid, can suppress abilities in battle."Swapping Abilities"Moves like Skill Swap can be used to give a new ability to PokÃ©mon during battle, enabling unique and creative team synergies."What are Held Items?"Held items are items which you can give your PokÃ©mon to benefit them during battle. They can increase their damage, heal them, or other things."Equipping an item"†You can give a PokÃ©mon an item from your bag, or through the summary screen. Not all items do an effect when held, so read carefully."Berries"†Berries are a common held item. During battles, PokÃ©mon will eat the berry to get a benefit. Get berries by picking from Berry Trees."Sitrus and Amwi Berry"£Sitrus Berry and Cado Berry are common berries which heal your PokÃ©mon when at low health. If in doubt about what item to give a PokÃ©mon, give them one of these."Rematerializer"~In PokÃ©mon Tectonic, the Rematerializer regenerates held items which are consumed in battle. You'll never run out of berries!"Wild Held Items"hWild PokÃ©mon can be found holding items. These items sometimes have held effects, but often don't."Getting More"You will find more held items on the ground when traveling, or as gifts from people, or as the reward for defeating Avatars, or as purchasable items in shops." What are Status Conditions?"‰Status Conditions are ailments a PokÃ©mon can have which hurt or restrict them. They remain after swapping out, and even between battles."Healing Status Conditions"`Status Conditions are removed when you heal at the PokÃ©Center or when you use the Aid Kit."Status Immunity"‡Type immunities do not prevent status moves. However, some types give immunities to certain status conditions. Don't confuse these two!"When burned, a PokÃ©mon's Attack is reduced by 33%, and loses 1/8th HP every turn. Fire- and Ghost-types do the most burning. Fire is immune."Frostbite"–When frostbitten, a PokÃ©mon's Sp. Atk is reduced by 33%, and loses 1/8th HP every turn. Ice- and Flying-types do the most frostbiting. Ice is immune."™When poisoned, a PokÃ©mon loses 1/10th HP every turn. This doubles every 2 turns. Poison- and Grass-types do the most poisoning. Poison/Steel are immune."When numbed, a PokÃ©mon's Speed is halved, and it deals 25% less damage. Electric- and Fighting-types do the most numbing. Electric is immune."‡When dizzied, a PokÃ©mon takes 25% more attack damage, and its ability doesn't function. Psychic- and Fairy-types do the most dizzying."–When leeched, a PokÃ©mon loses 1/10th HP every turn, and its opponent(s) split that health. Bug- and Dark-types do the most leeching. Grass is immune."A rarer status that causes a PokÃ©mon to be unable to do anything for 2 turns. Psychic- and Grass-types put PokÃ©mon to sleep the most often."What are Critical Hits?"zA critical hit deals 50% more damage than a regular hit. These naturally happen at random times on any damaging move.""How common are Critical Hits?"pThe base critical hit chance is 1 in 16. This chance can be raised by abilities, items, or special effects."Other Effects"Critical hits ignore stat steps (on the user or the target) that would lower their damage. They also ignore protective screens like Reflect and Light Screen."Preventing Criticals"ŸCertain abilities prevent critical hits against that Pokemon. The Lucky Chant effect and the Strategist tribe bonus also protect their side from critical hits."Guaranteed Criticals"•Some moves or abilities are not random, but guarantee a critical hit under certain conditions. Otherwise, these act the same as random critical hits."}Avatars cannot perform random critical hits. However, they can perform guaranteed critical hits from moves or abilities."What are Tribes?"¨Every PokÃ©mon has 1-3 Tribes, decided by their species. Have 5 PokÃ©mon of a shared Tribe on your team, and your entire team will receive that Tribe's bonus in battle!"Tribal Bonus"›Tribal Bonuses are not identical: each Tribe provides a unique boon. With careful team composition, you can have 2 or even 3 Tribal Bonuses active at once!"Are they important?"”Tribes are not required in any way to complete the game. They are simply an alternative team-building challenge to play with, like Single Type runs."What are Enemy Trainers?"”Enemy Trainers are the PokÃ©mon Trainers you will battle throughout the game. Some block your path forwards (like Gym Leaders), others are optional."Detecting Trainers"”Trainers are people who have a companion PokÃ©mon next to them. If a person doesn't have that, they either aren't a Trainer, or are an inactive one."Avoiding Trainers"ŸTrainers will challenge you if they see you within 4 tiles of them. Avoid them by going out of that distance, sneaking around them, or waiting until they move."Trainer Inactivity"³When you defeat a Trainer, they will become inactive until the next time you heal at a PokÃ©Center. This is indicated by them returning their companion PokÃ©mon to its PokÃ© Ball."Perfecting Fights"›If you defeat a Trainer without any of your PokÃ©mon fainting, you've 'perfected' the fight. They will leave forever and drop experience candy as a reward."Enemy Teams"›Enemy Trainers have their own teams of PokÃ©mon with their own moves and held items. It's important to pay attention to these possibilities to win battles."Differences"The typical trainer has 3 PokÃ©mon, but Gym Leaders will have more. Trainers with more PokÃ©mon also have more move variety and more items on their PokÃ©mon."Pro Trainers"°Pro Trainers are special Trainers, noted by their grey hair and black clothes. Their teams are always 6 PokÃ©mon, all with items, and built around a Tribal Bonus. They're hard!"Trainer Behaviour"¤Individual Trainers will always react to the same in-battle circumstances the same way. You can learn how to beat or even perfect a Trainer through trial and error."What are Avatars?"ˆAvatars are powerful enemy PokÃ©mon with unique properties that you will fight and destroy during your adventure. They cannot be caught."Avatars are Healthy"rAvatars have two health bars, which means they have a lot of health. Much more than double the normal amount!"Multi-Move"}Avatars can move twice each turn. Their second move will happen after every battler has used their regular move for the turn."Two Statuses"{Avatars are large, and have room for up to two status conditions at a time. They can't have two of the same condition."HP-Based Effects"€Effects that damage based on a fraction of total HP are only one-sixth as powerful against avatars, compared to normal PokÃ©mon."Primeval Moves"When a health bar is depleted, avatars will use a Primeval Move! Primeval Moves are powered-up versions of status moves, which also change the Avatar's type."Clean Slate"Before an Avatar uses a Primeval Move, they will also heal from any status conditions and reset any of their stat steps that have been lowered."Shields"The top of Avatars health bars starts Shielded. Shielded bars take 75% less damage. A shield is removed when the Avatar uses a Primeval Move."Attack Choice"|Avatars usually only have a few moves to choose from. They usually alternate between their moves on successive attacks."Target Choice"›A targeting reticle shows which of your battles the Avatar wants to attack. It will switch to another battler, however, if their attack is made impossible."Empowered Moves"‰Some Avatars have Empowered attacks, which are powered-up versions of other attacks. They take up both of an Avatar's moves on that turn."Experience Reward"oWhen an Avatar is destroyed, every PokÃ©mon on your team is given experience, even those that are fainted."Legendary Avatars"“Legendary Avatars are unique. You fight them with 3 PokÃ©mon, they have 3 HP bars, and they have more moves with more smarts about how to use them."What is the MasterDex?"^The MasterDex is an advanced encyclopedia about the 900+ PokÃ©mon available in this game."Single MasterDex"‹Access the MasterDex entry of a single PokÃ©mon when looking at a PokÃ©mon in the summary or the PC, or by using the Dex button in battles."Full MasterDex"—Access the full MasterDex from your pause menu, or by pressing D when using the Dex button in battles (while it's waiting for you to select a battler)."Searching"œWhen in the MasterDex, you can press your Special keybind (default Shift or Z) to open the first search page.

Only one weather can be active at once."Weather Duration"¢Weathers last a certain number of turns. The length differs depending on what move or ability summoned the weather. The duration can be extended by certain items."Sunshine"•Sunshine lowers attack damage by 15% and prevents crits. Fire and Grass-type moves/PokÃ©mon are immune to this.

Additionally, Fairy-type attacks are boosted by 30%."Weather Downsides"“Each weather has both an upside and a downside. There are items and abilities that make your PokÃ©mon immune to these downsides regardless of type."Weather Areas"›Certain areas in the game experience intense weather. That weather will also be present in the battles of that area. Simple daily weather will not do this."Weather Synergies"¢Each weather has dozens of moves and abilities that benefit from that weather.

You lose a battle if that happens to your PokÃ©mon."’1. Have as many PokÃ©mon as you can. 2. Level up your PokÃ©mon as much as you can. 3. Abuse type matchups. 4. Start battles with healthy PokÃ©mon."Team Size"–You can have a maximum of 6 PokÃ©mon with you at any time. This is known as your 'Team'. You can store extra PokÃ©mon using the PC in any PokÃ©Center."Levels"©Each PokÃ©mon has a level from 1 to 70. A PokÃ©mon's level determines its stats as well as what moves it could learn. Reaching high enough levels also unlocks Evolution."Types are strong or weak against other types. Having a variety of different types on your team helps you take advantage of these relationships."Healing your PokÃ©mon"yHeal your PokÃ©mon at PokÃ©Centers between battles. You can often use the Aid Kit instead to save on traveling time."Who goes first?"‰In battle, the PokÃ©mon with the higher speed stat gets to use their move first. Some moves modify this. Speed ties are decided randomly."Attacking vs Status"~Attacking moves deal damage. Status moves do not. Status moves are notated by a Yin/Yang symbol (White and Black intermixing)."Physical vs Special"¤Attacking moves are split into Physical moves, and Special moves. Each of these categories uses different stats to determine how much damage is dealt to the target."Physical Moves"¥Physical moves are notated by the symbol of a smashing fist. Their damage is based on the Attack (Atk) stat of the attacker and the Defense (Def) stat of the target."Special Moves"«Special moves are notated by the symbol of a splash. Their damage is based on the Special Attack (Sp. Atk) of the attacker and the Special Defense (Sp. Def) of the target."Targeting"µMost moves target only a single PokÃ©mon, but many can target multiple PokÃ©mon at once. Some moves differ in how far they can target in the bigger battle styles (doubles, triples)."Move Types"£Every move has a type. Attacking moves deal different amounts of damage to different PokÃ©mon based on those PokÃ©mon's types. This is called 'type effectiveness'."Same-Type Bonus"šPokÃ©mon deal 50% more damage with moves the share a type with them. For example, a Raichu deals 50% more damage with an Electric move than a Normal move."Learning Moves"ŠPokÃ©mon learn new moves as they level up. They can also learn moves from the 'Move Tutors' who sit in the left side of every PokÃ©Center."Base Power"Moves with higher Base Power deal more damage. Some moves deal variable Base Power depending on the situation. Status moves have no base power."–Accuracy is a move's chance of hitting. Most moves have 100% accuracy. Some effects can raise accuracy to let you use low-accuracy moves consistently."Power Points"ŠPower Points, or PP, is a number which limits how many times a move can be used. Healing at a PokÃ©Center or with the Aid Kit restores PP."—Each PokÃ©mon has type weakness and type resistances based on its own type. eg. Water deals double damage to Fire, and Fire deals half damage to Water."Type Combinations"±When a PokÃ©mon has two types, its type weaknesses and resistances multiply. A PokÃ©mon can be double weak or double resistant, or immune even though one of their types is weak."Normal Effective"SNormal Effective is the default effectiveness of all moves against a PokÃ©mon."Super Effective"USuper Effective moves deal double the damage compared to normal effective moves."Hyper Effective"ŠHyper Effective moves deal quadruple the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a PokÃ©mon is double weak to a type."Not Very Effective"VNot Very Effective moves deal half the damage compared to normal effective moves."Barely Effective"’Barely Effective moves deal one quarter the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a PokÃ©mon is double resistant to a type."Ineffective"¯Ineffective moves deal no damage at all. This can happen if one of a PokÃ©mon's types has an immunity to the attacking move type, even if the other is neutral (or even weak!)."Looking Up Matchups"‘The 5th and 6th pages of a MasterDex entry show that PokÃ©mon's type matchups. Open the MasterDex in battle to check matchups if you're not sure."Psychic vs Steel"PPsychic is now Super-Effective vs Steel.

Ice is Super-Effective against those types, so it's only natural!"Other changes"`Rock resists Ice. Fairy resists Dragon. Fairy is neutral against Fire. Bug resists Psychic."Why Get More?"Having choices of PokÃ©mon is important when facing challenges. A team of six is a bare minimum--it's best to catch more and pull them from the PC as needed."Methods of Aquiring"‹The two main methods of acquiring PokÃ©mon are catching them from the wild, and receiving them from other Trainers through gifts or trades."Catching Basics"®Wild PokÃ©mon will attack you if you walk through patches of grass, dark ground in caves, or other wild terrain. You can catch these PokÃ©mon by throwing PokÃ© Balls at them." Increase Catch Chance pt. 1"›Catching a PokÃ©mon isn't guaranteed. It's easier to catch PokÃ©mon when their health has been lowered by your attacks, or when they have a status ailment." Increase Catch Chance pt. 2"±Every time a PokÃ©mon breaks out of a ball, it'll be slightly easier to catch for the rest of the battle. You can check what your current catch chance is in the PokÃ© Ball menu."Finding Wild PokÃ©mon"ªUse the DexNav to get information on which PokÃ©mon are available where you are. You can also use it to find more PokÃ©mon of a species that you've already caught one of."Trades"Throughout the world there will be people offering trades for PokÃ©mon. Usually they want a different PokÃ©mon, but sometimes they want money."What are Stats?"gStats, short for Statistics, are the numbers which determine how your PokÃ©mon performs in battle."Checking Stats"ŠCheck your PokÃ©mon's stats by looking at the second page of their summary screen, accessible through the PokÃ©mon menu in the pause menu."Stat Factors"˜Your PokÃ©mon's stats are calculated from a combination of their species' 'Base Stats', their own 'Style Points', and extra modifications during battle."Base Stats"­Every species of PokÃ©mon have base stats, which affect every PokÃ©mon of that species. e.g. Every Raichu will be fast because the Raichu species has a high Speed base stat."Style Points"”Style Points are numbers which you can customize to change your PokÃ©mon's stats. Style Points show as blue numbers on the stat page of the summary."Leveling and Evolution"…Your PokÃ©mon's stats will increase every time they level up. When PokÃ©mon evolve, their stats change (almost always they increase)."Accuracy and Evasion"Accuracy and Evasion are two stats which are only active in battle, starting at 100% each. They are only modified by in-battle changing effects."Stat Steps"“Effects can modify a PokÃ©mon's stats during battle. These are called 'stat steps'. Stat steps multiply or divide the PokÃ©mon's listed stat value."Bounds of Stat Steps"Stat steps start at 0, and can increase up to +12 (4x) and down to -12 (.25x). Stat steps are reset if you swap the PokÃ©mon out or it faints."Checking Stat Steps"œYou can check the current stat steps of each PokÃ©mon on the battlefield using the Info button. It lists the numerical step as well as resultant multiplier."What are abilities?"Abilities are special powers that PokÃ©mon can have based on their species. Most PokÃ©mon can have one of 2 possible abilities."Ability Effects"‹Abilities do a wide variety of different things. Understanding your team's abilities, and choosing the right ones, is important to winning."Checking Abilities"‹Check your PokÃ©mon's summary to see what ability they have. Use the MasterDex to read about the abilities of enemy PokÃ©mon during battle."Choosing Abilities"A PokÃ©mon's ability is one of the two its species can have, randomly chosen when you get it. You can use Ability Capsules to swap to the other."Conditional Abilities"ƒMany abilities only do things under certain circumstances. Building around Weather and Room-synergy abilities is a common strategy."Effect Of Evolution"{A PokÃ©mon's ability tends to stay the same when evolving, but can change. When this happens, the game will alert you."Defeating Abilities"ƒAn enemy Trainer's ability too much? Abilities like Neutralizing Gas, and moves like Gastro Acid, can suppress abilities in battle."Swapping Abilities"Moves like Skill Swap can be used to give a new ability to PokÃ©mon during battle, enabling unique and creative team synergies."What are Held Items?"Held items are items which you can give your PokÃ©mon to benefit them during battle. They can increase their damage, heal them, or other things."Equipping an item"†You can give a PokÃ©mon an item from your bag, or through the summary screen. Not all items do an effect when held, so read carefully."Berries"†Berries are a common held item. During battles, PokÃ©mon will eat the berry to get a benefit. Get berries by picking from Berry Trees."Sitrus and Amwi Berry"£Sitrus Berry and Cado Berry are common berries which heal your PokÃ©mon when at low health. If in doubt about what item to give a PokÃ©mon, give them one of these."Rematerializer"~In PokÃ©mon Tectonic, the Rematerializer regenerates held items which are consumed in battle. You'll never run out of berries!"Wild Held Items"hWild PokÃ©mon can be found holding items. These items sometimes have held effects, but often don't."Getting More"You will find more held items on the ground when traveling, or as gifts from people, or as the reward for defeating Avatars, or as purchasable items in shops." What are Status Conditions?"‰Status Conditions are ailments a PokÃ©mon can have which hurt or restrict them. They remain after swapping out, and even between battles."Healing Status Conditions"`Status Conditions are removed when you heal at the PokÃ©Center or when you use the Aid Kit."Status Immunity"‡Type immunities do not prevent status moves. However, some types give immunities to certain status conditions. Don't confuse these two!"When burned, a PokÃ©mon's Attack is reduced by 33%, and loses 1/8th HP every turn. Fire- and Ghost-types do the most burning. Fire is immune."Frostbite"–When frostbitten, a PokÃ©mon's Sp. Atk is reduced by 33%, and loses 1/8th HP every turn. Ice- and Flying-types do the most frostbiting. Ice is immune."™When poisoned, a PokÃ©mon loses 1/10th HP every turn. This doubles every 2 turns. Poison- and Grass-types do the most poisoning. Poison/Steel are immune."When numbed, a PokÃ©mon's Speed is halved, and it deals 25% less damage. Electric- and Fighting-types do the most numbing. Electric is immune."‡When dizzied, a PokÃ©mon takes 25% more attack damage, and its ability doesn't function. Psychic- and Fairy-types do the most dizzying."–When leeched, a PokÃ©mon loses 1/10th HP every turn, and its opponent(s) split that health. Bug- and Dark-types do the most leeching. Grass is immune."A rarer status that causes a PokÃ©mon to be unable to do anything for 2 turns. Psychic- and Grass-types put PokÃ©mon to sleep the most often."What are Critical Hits?"zA critical hit deals 50% more damage than a regular hit. These naturally happen at random times on any damaging move.""How common are Critical Hits?"pThe base critical hit chance is 1 in 16. This chance can be raised by abilities, items, or special effects."Other Effects"Critical hits ignore stat steps (on the user or the target) that would lower their damage. They also ignore protective screens like Reflect and Light Screen."Preventing Criticals"ŸCertain abilities prevent critical hits against that Pokemon. The Lucky Chant effect and the Strategist tribe bonus also protect their side from critical hits."Guaranteed Criticals"•Some moves or abilities are not random, but guarantee a critical hit under certain conditions. Otherwise, these act the same as random critical hits."}Avatars cannot perform random critical hits. However, they can perform guaranteed critical hits from moves or abilities."What are Tribes?"¨Every PokÃ©mon has 1-3 Tribes, decided by their species. Have 5 PokÃ©mon of a shared Tribe on your team, and your entire team will receive that Tribe's bonus in battle!"Tribal Bonus"›Tribal Bonuses are not identical: each Tribe provides a unique boon. With careful team composition, you can have 2 or even 3 Tribal Bonuses active at once!"Are they important?"”Tribes are not required in any way to complete the game. They are simply an alternative team-building challenge to play with, like Single Type runs."What are Enemy Trainers?"”Enemy Trainers are the PokÃ©mon Trainers you will battle throughout the game. Some block your path forwards (like Gym Leaders), others are optional."Detecting Trainers"”Trainers are people who have a companion PokÃ©mon next to them. If a person doesn't have that, they either aren't a Trainer, or are an inactive one."Avoiding Trainers"ŸTrainers will challenge you if they see you within 4 tiles of them. Avoid them by going out of that distance, sneaking around them, or waiting until they move."Trainer Inactivity"³When you defeat a Trainer, they will become inactive until the next time you heal at a PokÃ©Center. This is indicated by them returning their companion PokÃ©mon to its PokÃ© Ball."Perfecting Fights"›If you defeat a Trainer without any of your PokÃ©mon fainting, you've 'perfected' the fight. They will leave forever and drop experience candy as a reward."Enemy Teams"›Enemy Trainers have their own teams of PokÃ©mon with their own moves and held items. It's important to pay attention to these possibilities to win battles."Differences"The typical trainer has 3 PokÃ©mon, but Gym Leaders will have more. Trainers with more PokÃ©mon also have more move variety and more items on their PokÃ©mon."Pro Trainers"°Pro Trainers are special Trainers, noted by their grey hair and black clothes. Their teams are always 6 PokÃ©mon, all with items, and built around a Tribal Bonus. They're hard!"Trainer Behaviour"¤Individual Trainers will always react to the same in-battle circumstances the same way. You can learn how to beat or even perfect a Trainer through trial and error."What are Avatars?"ˆAvatars are powerful enemy PokÃ©mon with unique properties that you will fight and destroy during your adventure. They cannot be caught."Avatars are Healthy"rAvatars have two health bars, which means they have a lot of health. Much more than double the normal amount!"Multi-Move"}Avatars can move twice each turn. Their second move will happen after every battler has used their regular move for the turn."Two Statuses"{Avatars are large, and have room for up to two status conditions at a time. They can't have two of the same condition."HP-Based Effects"€Effects that damage based on a fraction of total HP are only one-sixth as powerful against avatars, compared to normal PokÃ©mon."Primeval Moves"When a health bar is depleted, avatars will use a Primeval Move! Primeval Moves are powered-up versions of status moves, which also change the Avatar's type."Clean Slate"Before an Avatar uses a Primeval Move, they will also heal from any status conditions and reset any of their stat steps that have been lowered."Shields"The top of Avatars health bars starts Shielded. Shielded bars take 75% less damage. A shield is removed when the Avatar uses a Primeval Move."Attack Choice"|Avatars usually only have a few moves to choose from. They usually alternate between their moves on successive attacks."Target Choice"›A targeting reticle shows which of your battles the Avatar wants to attack. It will switch to another battler, however, if their attack is made impossible."Empowered Moves"‰Some Avatars have Empowered attacks, which are powered-up versions of other attacks. They take up both of an Avatar's moves on that turn."Experience Reward"oWhen an Avatar is destroyed, every PokÃ©mon on your team is given experience, even those that are fainted."Legendary Avatars"“Legendary Avatars are unique. You fight them with 3 PokÃ©mon, they have 3 HP bars, and they have more moves with more smarts about how to use them."What is the MasterDex?"^The MasterDex is an advanced encyclopedia about the 900+ PokÃ©mon available in this game."Single MasterDex"‹Access the MasterDex entry of a single PokÃ©mon when looking at a PokÃ©mon in the summary or the PC, or by using the Dex button in battles."Full MasterDex"—Access the full MasterDex from your pause menu, or by pressing D when using the Dex button in battles (while it's waiting for you to select a battler)."Searching"œWhen in the MasterDex, you can press your Special keybind (default Shift or Z) to open the first search page.

Only one weather can be active at once."Weather Duration"¢Weathers last a certain number of turns. The length differs depending on what move or ability summoned the weather.
