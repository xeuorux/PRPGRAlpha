Over and out."1Uh -- yes? Did you want to ask me something?"LWell then don't -- can you not -- I'm not a big fan of being stared at."íI just like... I‚Äôm a wanderer. Or, rather, not a wanderer -- but I don't have a home -- or, well -- excuse me. I spend most of my time in caves."ÅI don't know? I mean -- no, I know, but rather I'm not sure why -- I mean, what kind of question is that? I'm a Pok√©mon trainer."AOr I was. And I‚Äôm... rather good at it. And not much else."bA friend's. Just a friend's. I'm good at -- they entrust me with the training. I get results."aI mean, that sounds -- that's not what I really meant. I'm -- I'm -- I was -- let's move on."(Heyo, \PN. Hear you‚Äôve been busy."YYou‚Äôre just racking up badges like they‚Äôre nothing, huh? Mavis must be so proud."5It‚Äôs not a compliment. Just stating the facts."~And the fact is that you‚Äôre not getting anywhere now unless you come meet me, for reasons that make me too angry to explain."*I‚Äôve got a <imp>gift</imp> for you."ìI‚Äôm literally friends with two - I mean ONE - of those gym leaders, and I was the commanding officer for half the people keeping track of Rafael."Word gets around."kI also know that you‚Äôre gonna have some issues getting <imp>across that river</imp> without my help."Yikes."Yeah, Mavis is‚Ä¶ Mavis."CYou know, you‚Ä¶ ah, nevermind. Eye on the prize and all that."JSpeaking of which, you need to get <imp>across the river</imp>, yeah?"0We might be able to reach an arrangement...")But. But... you know how this works."TQuid pro quo, yeah? I know you‚Äôve scratched a few avatars off of my hit list."TGonna be clear as crystal here: you‚Äôre doing better than most of the rangers."\Such as the ones that recently just got mauled by a particularly ornery Steelix avatar."SYou know me so well. Put the thing in the ground ‚Äì well, more in the ground."cIt‚Äôs ripping through the mine yard in <imp>Grouz</imp> at the moment, which is‚Ä¶ a problem."YIf it goes down particular routes we could be facing a VERY uncomfortable situation."IThe rangers? Dealing with rampaging Tauros and crossroads hauntings."gAvatars are out of their paygrade. Not that we don‚Äôt send them in anyways and hope for the best."hSpeaking of which: <imp>Grouz</imp>. Squad went out and didn‚Äôt leave a scratch on the damn thing."/You can split it right open, though, yeah?"YYou don‚Äôt know what busy looks like, kid. You think I‚Äôm not trying to work here?"fI know you cut a deal with Helena. Same here: you accelerate my timetable, I do the same for you."USo make your way down to <imp>Grouz</imp> and turn that Steelix to slag. Please?"rI‚Äôll check back in on you when I hear that behemoth‚Äôs gone. Promise I‚Äôll make it worth your while, too."Capisce? Good. Bye."‚Ä¶She hung up."ABefore you can put your phone away, it starts ringing again."%It seems like an important call."*\PN, I need your help. It‚Äôs urgent."4You know the <imp>catacombs</imp> under Prizca?"JThere‚Äôs an entrance in the <imp>sewers</imp>. I need you here, now."ZI‚Äôll explain when you get here ‚Äì this isn‚Äôt the most secure way to communicate."DIt‚Äôs bad, though. Real bad. I need a trainer of your caliber."[Thanks. I know this is sudden, but I can‚Äôt overstate how much I need your help ASAP."JListen, kid, if I could call in a couple Chasm strike teams, I would."uBut things change, and now all I have is you. You are NOT going to like the consequences if you don‚Äôt help me."Please."=Bring the best team you‚Äôve got. It‚Äôs gonna get ugly."?Hey, just checking in. What‚Äôs going on? Making progress?"SOh, wow. Really trying your li‚Äôl heart out, aren‚Äôt you? More than one gym!",Ah, don‚Äôt get all broken up about it."[You could be in the big city with six badges under your belt and it wouldn‚Äôt matter."Why, I never."6Haven‚Äôt you heard blood‚Äôs thicker than water?""Practically a type advantage.")Well, whatever -- keep your secrets."8As for me, I‚Äôm taking a break before facing Noel."nYou don‚Äôt know him -- and, let‚Äôs be honest, you probably never will -- but he‚Äôs kind of a big deal."bSo while you‚Äôre scuttling to and fro like a Falinks without an officer, I‚Äôll be relaxing."Wish you were here!"He hung up‚Ä¶"(Wow, that was‚Ä¶ a complete breeze."A joke, honestly."&That‚Äôs my sixth badge now. You?"Wow. I remember that."1Wait, how did you even schedule a challenge?"4I made an appointment before I got on the ship."2You... you're serious about this, aren't you?"That can‚Äôt be right."You‚Äôre better than that."UNot by much, but if you‚Äôre lying, then‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre taking this seriously. Huh."Hah! That never gets old."LYou remind me of‚Ä¶ I guess a Zangoose, right? So angry, but so normal.",But you are really angry, aren‚Äôt you?"\Well, you‚Äôve certainly made good time, but this is where things start getting harder."1You‚Äôve still got a lot of ground to cover."!See you at the championship!"4I‚Äôll make sure to look in the stands for you."He hung up‚Ä¶ again."/Hey, \PN. Things going well on your front?"0Good. You‚Äôve got eight badges now, right?"xThat‚Äôs... it‚Äôs something. You‚Äôll excuse me if I‚Äôm not too preoccupied with the whole gym challenge shebang."That makes one of us."KBetween the avatars and... recent developments... I‚Äôve been swamped."XYeah, frickin‚Äô tell me about it. I know exactly what you‚Äôre talking about, too."ZListen: I know the stress is probably getting to you, but we‚Äôre in the endgame now."_Be a hero, become Champion, go home to Mavis. Everyone‚Äôs happy, right? Smiles all round."(So, yeah, just a li‚Äôl bit longer."}Take down those avatars if you can spare the time, come back to Prizca for the Championship, and... we‚Äôll see about Yezera."&Thanks, \PN. I know it‚Äôs a lot."Thanks."MWhoever the hell it is helping Yezera, they‚Äôve been making the rounds."iGood news is that you seem to be their priority. Haven‚Äôt been, y‚Äôknow, rampaging. Which is good."êI‚Äôve had zero luck trying to track them down. I‚Äôd hire Alessa again if she‚Äôd return my calls ‚Äì but, hey, that‚Äôs why I have you, right?"Yes and no. You‚Äôre gonna have to cut through some of the best trainers in the region, but it ain‚Äôt just busywork this time."jNot that it ever is ‚Äì thanks, by the way ‚Äì but this one should be especially interesting for you."jThat‚Äôs what I like to hear. This ain‚Äôt gonna be an easy operation, but I trust in your abilities."gMostly in committing violence. Lots of violence. Though, actually, maybe try talking this one out?"4You‚Äôre gonna want to hear this one. Trust me."wI mean, you‚Äôve got a minute before the Championship anyways. This op is... it‚Äôs pretty dire, importance- wise."gI‚Äôve got a confirmed sighting on Yezera. She‚Äôs back in her hometown ‚Äì <imp>Whitebloom</imp>."eYezera‚Äôs got a few titans on her and some kind of master plan, so she‚Äôs your first priority."a\PN... thanks in advance. Try and be understanding with Yezera. She‚Äôs... dealt with a lot." But do what you have to do."\Do what you have to do, come back to Prizca for the tournament, and go home a Champion."$Happy endings all-round, right?"Right. Bye."GHey-o! Been a lil' bit but I managed to pry your number from Zain."aSucks that I couldn't face you in the Tournament, but I've got a surprise to make up for it!"cHeard about this place called the <imp>Battle Monument</imp>. It's for top trainers to battle."zThey're weird about directly inviting people, but you're a champion so you should just waltz right in. It'll be fine."XI'll send the GPS coordinates to you so you can sail on over and give it a looksie."kOh yeah, guess I didn't say before, but the Battle Monument is a big tower in the middle of the ocean."IIf I didn't know better, I'd think it was some evil villainous lair."BAnyways, I'll still be hanging around the Tournament grounds."tThere's still lots of trainers here, and I've got some new team configurations I really wanna try against them!"..."t...Ok yeah someone here just asked to battle me, and I'm not gonna turn that down, so I gotta end the call now."VHope you're doing well, be safe, make good choices, have fun, et cetera. Bye bye!"‚Ä¶They hung up.",They must really want to talk with you."dA couple seconds later, you receive a text message with the coordinates to the Battle Monument."Hello to you, young one."It is I, Dr. Hekata."TDo not worry about how I learned of your cellphone number. I simply divined it."2I have a topic to discuss of some importance."PI beseech you‚Äî<imp>visit my abode in Grouz</imp>. There we shall discuss."DApologies for the interruption to your adventure, young master."wHowever, given that you've sent a number of Pokemon to Storage, I thought it best that I inform you of my project."GTo make it short: Your family owns an unused Estate here in Makya."pSince you're taking on the Makyan Gym Challenge, I took the initiative to renovate the grounds for our use."dI've set up a system that sends the Pokemon you store in your PC to this <imp>Pok√âstate</imp>."GI'll take care of them there while you are busy with your journey."pI love Pokemon variety, so I've prepared lots of <imp>EXP Candy</imp> to give you as your collection grows."COnce you've earned some, I'll send them to you through the PC."nI'll continue to wait for you on the boat. If you want to visit the Pok√âstate, send me a ping at any PC."%I'll take you there immediately."?That is all. I will distract you no further, young master."A\i[TAROTAMULET]The Tarot Amulet spasms like something dying."uYou feel your pupils dilate and somewhere bleak and broken almost comes into view at the corners of your vision."SA woman‚Äôs voice whispers from that place ‚Äì almost familiar, but not quite."8You shouldn‚Äôt have reversed that amulet, dearest."<The woman who gave it to you was trying to protect you."QNow, though, charms for safe beginnings turn to invitations of dire endings."gMaybe there‚Äôs something to learn from interlacing your journey with the path of ordeals, though."zEnjoy this brief, bitter taste of the end, darling, and I‚Äôll try and pull some strings should you prove victorious."3\i[TAROTAMULET]Once again the amulet twitches."UOnce again, you can almost make something out, just past your peripheral vision."Once again, she speaks."(Oh? You‚Äôre back, dearest. Lovely."UThese people are tied inextricably to this region‚Äôs secrets; its conspiracies."oLet me implant a bit of my demesne into theirs, and I might be able to tease them open like a faulty lock."@You want to know more, don‚Äôt you?

You‚Äôll understand eventually."6Go on. Show me what a conqueror you are, darling."Z\i[TAROTAMULET]At this point, you can almost hear fate whimpering through the amulet."3Her voice shushes it, but does not comfort it."ÄWhere did Imogene get this thing? I doubt she realized the significance of the sliver of stone she implanted within this amulet."QIt was uplifted from a forbidden place where history is tortuous and frayed."ÑIts latent power, the witch‚Äôs arcana, and, of course, my‚Ä¶ expertise‚Ä¶ all aligned to make my little bits of influence possible."-I hope you feel lucky, darling: you are."Always."\i[TAROTAMULET]....."MThere‚Äôs something calming about the hellscape you can almost perceive."*It‚Äôs a calm hell; quiet and somber." Her voice is much the same."ÅIf only I could twist these gym leaders‚Äô roles without having to suffuse their arenas with my demesne and all its‚Ä¶ antipathy."*History ends quietly, but not kindly."OHere, our day-to-day lives are much like what you endure in these battles."Oh, don‚Äôt pity me. My only point is that I would gladly spare you the intensity of fate‚Äôs dying gasps if I could, trust me."Trust me, darling."v\i[TAROTAMULET]As the amulet twists and writhes, you can feel the tension of invisible threads being pulled taut."8They are wrapped around the amulet, and around you."sSomewhere behind you they frayed into thousands of strands, and ahead of you they extend to somewhere distant."There they all end.":You understand by now, don‚Äôt you? Makya is history.">You, darling, are a history to me ‚Äì a singular history."3And I am a singular history projected forward."éYou have the benefit of what we‚Äôll call a privileged reference frame, and I thank you dearly for letting me glimpse through your eyes at it."0Not to mention making a few‚Ä¶ alterations."+Don‚Äôt think too hard on it, dearest.".\i[TAROTAMULET]The amulet has gone still."^Something is changing ‚Äì the threads are being woven back together, or severed, or both."4Someone is taking matters into their own hands."No, that isn‚Äôt me."0We both know who it is, though, don‚Äôt we?"dYou should probably stop her from doing that, or one of us could end up in the other‚Äôs place."IYou were not made for the terminus, and I was not made for a utopia."=And no human was made for the paradise she‚Äôs planning.",‚Ä¶\PN, you know who I am, don‚Äôt you?"]We won‚Äôt be speaking for a little while, but know that I‚Äôm watching over you, child."My child."‚Ä¶Agonizingly familiar."[But, still, she is a stranger to you, this woman who almost has your mother‚Äôs voice."No."Why are you down here?"Who are you?"Whose Pok√©mon are those?"How do you know?"I doubt it."You want it gone?"What are they good for?"I'm busy."

@keys[Ô"Breaking News!"lI'm live here at <imp>Tri Island</imp>, a mysterious island discovered recently off the coast of Makya."ÄTrainers from all over the world are making their way over as there have been sightings of extremely rare Pokemon and resources."âWith no region claiming major jurisdiction over the island, there have been reports of multiple factions creating base camps in the area."}The only thing that's certain here is the battling as Trainers duke it out over territory and access to these new wild areas."NBut for now, we'll be providing live coverage of the event. Over and out."1Uh -- yes? Did you want to ask me something?"LWell then don't -- can you not -- I'm not a big fan of being stared at."íI just like... I‚Äôm a wanderer. Or, rather, not a wanderer -- but I don't have a home -- or, well -- excuse me. I spend most of my time in caves."ÅI don't know? I mean -- no, I know, but rather I'm not sure why -- I mean, what kind of question is that? I'm a Pok√©mon trainer."AOr I was. And I‚Äôm... rather good at it. And not much else."bA friend's. Just a friend's. I'm good at -- they entrust me with the training. I get results."aI mean, that sounds -- that's not what I really meant. I'm -- I'm -- I was -- let's move on."(Heyo, \PN. Hear you‚Äôve been busy."YYou‚Äôre just racking up badges like they‚Äôre nothing, huh? Mavis must be so proud."5It‚Äôs not a compliment. Just stating the facts."~And the fact is that you‚Äôre not getting anywhere now unless you come meet me, for reasons that make me too angry to explain."*I‚Äôve got a <imp>gift</imp> for you."ìI‚Äôm literally friends with two - I mean ONE - of those gym leaders, and I was the commanding officer for half the people keeping track of Rafael."Word gets around."kI also know that you‚Äôre gonna have some issues getting <imp>across that river</imp> without my help."Yikes."Yeah, Mavis is‚Ä¶ Mavis."CYou know, you‚Ä¶ ah, nevermind. Eye on the prize and all that."JSpeaking of which, you need to get <imp>across the river</imp>, yeah?"0We might be able to reach an arrangement...")But. But... you know how this works."TQuid pro quo, yeah? I know you‚Äôve scratched a few avatars off of my hit list."TGonna be clear as crystal here: you‚Äôre doing better than most of the rangers."\Such as the ones that recently just got mauled by a particularly ornery Steelix avatar."SYou know me so well. Put the thing in the ground ‚Äì well, more in the ground."cIt‚Äôs ripping through the mine yard in <imp>Grouz</imp> at the moment, which is‚Ä¶ a problem."YIf it goes down particular routes we could be facing a VERY uncomfortable situation."IThe rangers? Dealing with rampaging Tauros and crossroads hauntings."gAvatars are out of their paygrade. Not that we don‚Äôt send them in anyways and hope for the best."hSpeaking of which: <imp>Grouz</imp>.

Please?"rI‚Äôll check back in on you when I hear that behemoth‚Äôs gone. Promise I‚Äôll make it worth your while, too."Capisce? Good. Bye."‚Ä¶She hung up."ABefore you can put your phone away, it starts ringing again."%It seems like an important call."*\PN, I need your help. It‚Äôs urgent."4You know the <imp>catacombs</imp> under Prizca?"JThere‚Äôs an entrance in the <imp>sewers</imp>. I need you here, now."ZI‚Äôll explain when you get here ‚Äì this isn‚Äôt the most secure way to communicate."DIt‚Äôs bad, though. Real bad. I need a trainer of your caliber."[Thanks. I know this is sudden, but I can‚Äôt overstate how much I need your help ASAP."JListen, kid, if I could call in a couple Chasm strike teams, I would."uBut things change, and now all I have is you. You are NOT going to like the consequences if you don‚Äôt help me."Please."=Bring the best team you‚Äôve got. It‚Äôs gonna get ugly."?Hey, just checking in. What‚Äôs going on? Making progress?"SOh, wow. Really trying your li‚Äôl heart out, aren‚Äôt you? More than one gym!",Ah, don‚Äôt get all broken up about it."[You could be in the big city with six badges under your belt and it wouldn‚Äôt matter."Why, I never."6Haven‚Äôt you heard blood‚Äôs thicker than water?""Practically a type advantage.")Well, whatever -- keep your secrets."8As for me, I‚Äôm taking a break before facing Noel."nYou don‚Äôt know him -- and, let‚Äôs be honest, you probably never will -- but he‚Äôs kind of a big deal."bSo while you‚Äôre scuttling to and fro like a Falinks without an officer, I‚Äôll be relaxing."Wish you were here!"He hung up‚Ä¶"(Wow, that was‚Ä¶ a complete breeze."A joke, honestly."&That‚Äôs my sixth badge now.

Huh."Hah! That never gets old."LYou remind me of‚Ä¶ I guess a Zangoose, right? So angry, but so normal.",But you are really angry, aren‚Äôt you?"\Well, you‚Äôve certainly made good time, but this is where things start getting harder."1You‚Äôve still got a lot of ground to cover."!See you at the championship!"4I‚Äôll make sure to look in the stands for you."He hung up‚Ä¶ again."/Hey, \PN. Things going well on your front?"0Good. You‚Äôve got eight badges now, right?"xThat‚Äôs... it‚Äôs something. You‚Äôll excuse me if I‚Äôm not too preoccupied with the whole gym challenge shebang."That makes one of us."KBetween the avatars and... recent developments... I‚Äôve been swamped."XYeah, frickin‚Äô tell me about it. I know exactly what you‚Äôre talking about, too."ZListen: I know the stress is probably getting to you, but we‚Äôre in the endgame now."_Be a hero, become Champion, go home to Mavis. Everyone‚Äôs happy, right? Smiles all round."(So, yeah, just a li‚Äôl bit longer."}Take down those avatars if you can spare the time, come back to Prizca for the Championship, and... we‚Äôll see about Yezera."&Thanks, \PN. I know it‚Äôs a lot."Thanks."MWhoever the hell it is helping Yezera, they‚Äôve been making the rounds."iGood news is that you seem to be their priority. Haven‚Äôt been, y‚Äôknow, rampaging. Which is good."êI‚Äôve had zero luck trying to track them down. I‚Äôd hire Alessa again if she‚Äôd return my calls ‚Äì but, hey, that‚Äôs why I have you, right?"Yes and no. You‚Äôre gonna have to cut through some of the best trainers in the region, but it ain‚Äôt just busywork this time."jNot that it ever is ‚Äì thanks, by the way ‚Äì but this one should be especially interesting for you."jThat‚Äôs what I like to hear. This ain‚Äôt gonna be an easy operation, but I trust in your abilities."gMostly in committing violence. Lots of violence. Though, actually, maybe try talking this one out?"4You‚Äôre gonna want to hear this one. Trust me."wI mean, you‚Äôve got a minute before the Championship anyways. This op is... it‚Äôs pretty dire, importance- wise."gI‚Äôve got a confirmed sighting on Yezera. She‚Äôs back in her hometown ‚Äì <imp>Whitebloom</imp>."eYezera‚Äôs got a few titans on her and some kind of master plan, so she‚Äôs your first priority."a\PN... thanks in advance. Try and be understanding with Yezera. She‚Äôs... dealt with a lot." But do what you have to do."\Do what you have to do, come back to Prizca for the tournament, and go home a Champion."$Happy endings all-round, right?"Right. Bye."GHey-o! Been a lil' bit but I managed to pry your number from Zain."aSucks that I couldn't face you in the Tournament, but I've got a surprise to make up for it!"cHeard about this place called the <imp>Battle Monument</imp>. It's for top trainers to battle."zThey're weird about directly inviting people, but you're a champion so you should just waltz right in. It'll be fine."XI'll send the GPS coordinates to you so you can sail on over and give it a looksie."kOh yeah, guess I didn't say before, but the Battle Monument is a big tower in the middle of the ocean."IIf I didn't know better, I'd think it was some evil villainous lair."BAnyways, I'll still be hanging around the Tournament grounds."tThere's still lots of trainers here, and I've got some new team configurations I really wanna try against them!"..."t...Ok yeah someone here just asked to battle me, and I'm not gonna turn that down, so I gotta end the call now."VHope you're doing well, be safe, make good choices, have fun, et cetera.

I hope you‚Äôve come prepared to answer a few questions."1Thank you. I would like a firsthand account.".Concerning the avatars and their effects."#No, but I would appreciate it."2Understandable. I require more data, however."_Upon more elaborate consideration, I decided to not have you present our findings with me."`I think you‚Äôll be glad to hear that. I would like to hear your personal opinions, though."aCould you give me an estimate of how many avatars you have fought during your time in Makya?"JSignificantly more encounters than the average individual, certainly."That many? Noted."ZI have my own estimates based on public records and hearsay. I will default to those."nDo you take no thrill in defeating these beings? Unfortunately I fear you may be an expert in the matter."<So, have you noticed any common traits between avatars?"(As the local people have found out.";I will trust your judgment, as an experienced battler.".Ah, yes. I‚Äôve heard of this phenomenon."tI have my suspicions that the true nature of the avatars and Makya‚Äôs unique properties share a common origin."ÄThe unique ecological pressures that create the Makyan forms must stem from the same source as the avatars. I‚Äôm certain of it."vThis region has several pockets of blatantly unnatural climatology ‚Äì its immense cave network chief among them."BThere is more to this region than I have discovered thus far."M...But, excuse me. I am not asking questions. I am talking your ear off."mI need to collect my findings to present to the local experts in regional forms and the ranger captains."YI would like to talk with you again. Do you know the <imp>menagerie in Velenz</imp>?"#I would suggest we meet there."öThough, considering the timing, it would perhaps be better to wait until after the tournament is over. That way at least one burden will be off your mind."JIn fact, if it may help you in achieving a quick victory, take these." Best of luck. Goodbye, \PN."oWelcome to the Novo College Informational Site! Please select one of the following subjects to learn more!"kMakyan paleontology is in an exciting time. Recent excursions have promised field-shaking discoveries."çThe avatar crisis has only existed for less than half a year, but already fossil analysis has found striking resemblances to ancient Pokemon."lSkeletons found by researchers are significantly larger than the bone structure of modern counterparts."DNovo College has an accoladed history in the material sciences."fThe Rematerializer was voted by Trainers as one of the most useful inventions in the last decade."WWe also work closely with Pokemon Centers in order to improve medicinal practices."kMakya has a stunningly biodiverse ecosystem, which has raised the mystery of how it got to that point."zOne theory is that immigration to the region has brought stowaway Pokemon, or foreign Pokemon released into the wild."QAnother theory is the Makyan environmental policy is particularly effective."ìFor both theories, the counterargument is that fossil records show that Makya has had this biodiversity before human settlements were even founded."{In collaboration with Eko, Novo Town's Gym Leader, Novo Colllege is developing new pain-relief medication for Pokemon."rWhile status-relieving medicine serves a purpose, its main flaw is that it is reactive rather than proactive."ÄAs a response to this issue, the College has been working to develop a new ointment, which can be applied to Pokemon once a day."RUnlike existing medicines, it serves to stop status pains before they happen."zPokemon in the midst of battle will still feel the effects, long-term pain will be numbed a few minutes after combat."ùCareer battling Pokemon benefit most from this, as continued exposure to untreated status can result in chronic pains once the Pokemon retires from battling."äThe avatar crisis has disrupted much of Makya's already strained infrastructure, as travel between settlements has become quite dangerous."}To help combat this, Novo College has been offering free courses to Trainers and Rangers who wish to keep Makyan routes safe."]Multiple professors and students work to develop new strategies to defeat these avatars."nExperienced Trainers with a history of battling avatars are encouraged to volunteer in educational roles."|One of the College's latest projects involved tracking genetic signatures in the Golett, Baltoy, and Castform families."qWhile the exact methods of reproduction elude scientists, many suspect that selection forces remain at play."ÉHow this natural selection impacts man-made Pokemon could have remarkable insights on how other Pokemon change form over millennia."9Applications for the current school year are closed."1Acceptance letters will be sent out shortly."[LuxTech Scholars will be contacted by a representative on their first week of classes.">Our college isn't too grand, but we have three ace areas."0Paleontology, 3D printing, and electronics."`When you combine them, you get the largest fossil studies and revival program in the world!"No"Yes"You're stealing Pok√©mon?"You're rescuing Pok√©mon?"

Yet, that time is where they became who they are to us.".One day, maybe, we can forgive ourselves."/They never look at us the same afterwards."You realize you cannot imagine them without thinking about how their expression changed when they learned of your failure."aSometimes, it is a necessary mistake to make. There is no growth if we let ourselves simmer."4Then you are blessed now and cursed to feel it."]But that is life, young one. You must realize that, as we love to say, it is what it is."<I am filled with sorrow. It is the price I pay for joy."SBut I am not helpless. I choose to pay again and again. Each time it worth it."ONow, Trainer, will you show me a little bit of the joy you feel in battle?"hThere is no joy in battle without the bitterness of frustration. Let us pay your dues to our wiles."Ahah! Take that!"bA-hem, I mean, frustration is a natural part of growth. Grow, and approach me again, Trainer."6Afriad? Or cautious? Ah, well, it doesn't matter."-I will be here. We all smile eventually."@Perhaps you have caught a glimpse of that feeling, Trainer."rIt matters not, you will feel it soon enough. It will feel wonderful and awful and all of those great things."?I will collect my feelings before I leave. I'll be inside."9If you would like to follow, you are more than free."'A guest! What a pleasant surprise!"KHave you come to challenge me? I have a bit of time to test my mettle."MAh, but before we get too far ahead of myself, I must sate my curiosity."[You seem no stranger to struggle, but tell me, have you ever been broken by challenge?"RUtterly shattered. Reduced. Something you viewed as damningly insurmountable?"jHmm, bold. It is one thing to break yourself for another. It is another for them to mock your pieces."RIt can be a moment that defines your world, and you are not in control of it."{And you certainly you gained something in the end! Of course, you know as well as any that the real danger lies afterwards."VIt is one thing to climb a mountain once. It is another to climb a hill each day."8If honesty were a virtue, you'd qualify as a saint." Not that it's a good thing."ÅThen there is something you must do, now! There is a wide open world out there, but you must be torn down for a new life to grow!"hBut I digress. The force of will takes man and mon far, but it cannot always overcome cold reality."?This island will be gone. There are some that refute that."pSometimes, there is value in fighting the inevitable. Sometimes. I am never sure about it until it is over."QThere are those who try to preserve this place, as foolish as that might be."TI wonder how it will end up for them. It is a good trial, and a proper funeral."mBut that is them. I should focus on myself. I am ready for challenge. Are you ready for battle, Trainer?"Excellent!"ANow is the time! Let us break and reform from our struggles!"%And you lay before me in pieces."bThere's only one direction to go from here. Regain youself, and try again. You can do better.">Very well, but do not leave me waiting. I abhor idleness."OI am looking for one last trail myself. Are you ready for battle, Trainer?"4Wonderful! It was about time for me to shatter!"lI revel in that sting you get when you know you've been outmatched! It is undeniable, how jealous I am!">But such a feeling is fleeting, for better and for worse."TIt's time for me to get ready for the next hill. I'll be inside if you need me.";These Guardians have been here since before all of us."9If there is a way forward, they will bring us there."/You have snuffed out any hope that we had."1I'm not sure that it was a good or bad deed."(We seek its power to heal our home."You must have a plan!"0Centuries of guidance cannot end like this!"VSo many here wish to give up our homeland. To what! Simple time and happenstance?"UI will depart, but I will be bitter. The spirit of our island will sink with it."LI am surrounded by fools! The sages are right! We must adapt or perish!"Leave me be, outsider."LMy Rampardos and I have a unique camaraderie. We suffer from hair loss."4I need to get a sick crown like my Rampardos..."5I must treat the little hair I have left kindly."#Mmm. Maybe I should buy a hat."eHon hon! This island has exceptional beauty! It is a shame I will be the last visitor to see it."TOh, are you also foreign to here? Well, that ruins the title of "last visitor"."1Ah, the locals here are so good at battling."/I think I'll enjoy a fine Kalosian wine..."ZLook towards the future, Trainer. You might miss how much of a mess the past becomes."2Come, my Pokemon. Let us take a final stroll."0It's a shame how the past has been tainted."IWe are old minded here. But our ways are nothing in front of nature."aWe like to forget that we are still a part of nature, no matter how high we build ourselves."Winning the Championship."Helping a friend."!Telling someone to buzz off."Letting go of my past."	Yes."Not right now."Yes, when I lost someone."

Besides that, I‚Äôm masked for a reason."iI would ask who you are, but quite frankly it doesn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm going to find out soon enough."9There‚Äôs only so many types of people in the world.":I just told you: because humiliating you will be fun."MUnless you mean extracting Regidrago, in which case, no, I won‚Äôt tell."bHumans have this infuriatingly self-destructive need to tell secrets. I‚Äôm better than that."3Well, I see the dialogue‚Äôs broken down fast."Fine.

It doesn‚Äôt make any sense.">She should be the last person to pull this kind of stunt."XIt is. It‚Äôs your problem now, and I know you aren‚Äôt gonna like that, but it is."5This is bigger than just one legendary Pok√©mon."4Remember what I said about the big open secret?"oThe caves around Makya are tombs for the Regis. The weird ones I was talking about before. Ones like this."NWell, some archaeological teams went to study them a couple decades back."yAnd then they found the Regis, and the rich mineral veins, and the ruins, and they figured they could leverage that."{We got some corporate backing from Andris and Mavis, and boom: Team Chasm. I was one of those original archaeologists."n‚Ä¶Some of us. Helena wanted to run her own region. Andris wanted a piece of the organized crime bigtime."QMe, I study the Regis. And some people wanted me to leave well enough alone."jI had a Team and Regidrago on my side, and they didn‚Äôt, so I got to study what I damn well pleased."LSome of us. I didn‚Äôt. I had five Regis ‚Äì what did I need money for?"8If I wanted lab equipment, I sent a list to Helena."GI lived in a research station and ate ramen. Best days of my life."oI just wanted to study the Regis, and with their power, nobody could tell me no. Funny how that works out.")You make it sound so pure and noble."bI was curious. Wanted answers. I got them ‚Äì who could tell me no with Regidrago at my side?"YNot to mention the full might of Team Chasm, 'cause my research was VERY profitable."QI‚Äôm getting to that, but also, hey, it could come in handy some day, yeah?"5As I was saying: we found the five lesser Regis."\It took me years, but I deciphered their inscriptions and understood their true nature."JThat led us to Regigigas, and at that point we were cooking with gas."RGigas was stronger than the rest of the Regis put together, and smarter, too."|Shape the earth, revert it back to some kind of primordial clay. Create seals and wards that nothing could get through."2And, yeah, it could throw a mean Giga Impact."iIt could do‚Ä¶ other things, too. We found a way to make it create ethereal Pok√©mon with its power.";They were hostile, powerful ‚Äì had to be locked away."}And then by the time Yezera kicked down our door and told us to stop, she was basically just confirming what we already knew."pWe were playing with fire. If we kept using Regigigas, we ran the very real chance of destroying the world."`Or at least permanently changing it. So we put each Regi back in their tomb and went legit."iThe tombs were reinforced, of course ‚Äì just about nothing can get through the minor Regi chambers."KGigas‚Äôs chamber can only be opened by the other five Regis together."_I don‚Äôt know. She agreed with us: it was too dangerous. We were criminals, not lunatics."MI know things‚Ä¶ haven‚Äôt been great for her, but this? This is insane."[Who knows. We knew some groups were trying to get them back ‚Äì they always have been."PBut succeeding? There was no way. Impossible. But‚Ä¶ apparently Yezera can."*‚Ä¶Probably. They might already have."nGigas‚Äôs chamber is deep down, though, and if they haven‚Äôt broken the seal yet, it‚Äôd be for nothing."QOr if they‚Äôve resealed it. I can try and scout it out, but‚Ä¶ no promises."^My POINT is that if you don‚Äôt help out, you better get used to the look of white stone."]You‚Äôre gonna be seeing a whole lot more of it if someone tells Regigigas to let loose."<Listen, I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know a lot of things."sSo let me talk to Andris, our rangers, Helena, whoever else I can find. We‚Äôll figure out how bad things are."PAnd if these thieves show their faces aboveground, you can brawl with them."~They‚Äôve got at least one Regi, probably more, so there‚Äôs a strong temptation to wreak havoc. Trust me ‚Äì I‚Äôd know."JHate to say it, but you just need to keep being your usual self, kid."JOr, no, I shouldn‚Äôt call you kid. Take this ‚Äì you‚Äôve earned it."AUsed to give these to Chasm strike teams, for cave scouting."UIt‚Äôll get you just about anywhere in the region ‚Äì nobody hides from you now."3So go get those badges and save the day, hero."Who are you?"Why are you doing this?"Shut up, edgelord."Who are they?"What do they want?"Why Yezera?"Not my problem."You wanted power?"You wanted money?"You

The weird ones I was talking about before. Ones like this."NWell, some archaeological teams went to study them a couple decades back."yAnd then they found the Regis, and the rich mineral veins, and the ruins, and they figured they could leverage that."{We got some corporate backing from Andris and Mavis, and boom: Team Chasm. I was one of those original archaeologists."n‚Ä¶Some of us. Helena wanted to run her own region. Andris wanted a piece of the organized crime bigtime."QMe, I study the Regis. And some people wanted me to leave well enough alone."jI had a Team and Regidrago on my side, and they didn‚Äôt, so I got to study what I damn well pleased."LSome of us. I didn‚Äôt. I had five Regis ‚Äì what did I need money for?"8If I wanted lab equipment, I sent a list to Helena."GI lived in a research station and ate ramen. Best days of my life."oI just wanted to study the Regis, and with their power, nobody could tell me no. Funny how that works out.")You make it sound so pure and noble."bI was curious. Wanted answers. I got them ‚Äì who could tell me no with Regidrago at my side?"YNot to mention the full might of Team Chasm, 'cause my research was VERY profitable."QI‚Äôm getting to that, but also, hey, it could come in handy some day, yeah?"5As I was saying: we found the five lesser Regis."\It took me years, but I deciphered their inscriptions and understood their true nature."JThat led us to Regigigas, and at that point we were cooking with gas."RGigas was stronger than the rest of the Regis put together, and smarter, too."|Shape the earth, revert it back to some kind of primordial clay. Create seals and wards that nothing could get through."2And, yeah, it could throw a mean Giga Impact."iIt could do‚Ä¶ other things, too. We found a way to make it create ethereal Pok√©mon with its power.";They were hostile, powerful ‚Äì had to be locked away."}And then by the time Yezera kicked down our door and told us to stop, she was basically just confirming what we already knew."pWe were playing with fire. If we kept using Regigigas, we ran the very real chance of destroying the world."`Or at least permanently changing it. So we put each Regi back in their tomb and went legit."iThe tombs were reinforced, of course ‚Äì just about nothing can get through the minor Regi chambers."KGigas‚Äôs chamber can only be opened by the other five Regis together."_I don‚Äôt know. She agreed with us: it was too dangerous. We were criminals, not lunatics."MI know things‚Ä¶ haven‚Äôt been great for her, but this? This is insane."[Who knows. We knew some groups were trying to get them back ‚Äì they always have been."PBut succeeding? There was no way. Impossible. But‚Ä¶ apparently Yezera can."*‚Ä¶Probably. They might already have."nGigas‚Äôs chamber is deep down, though, and if they haven‚Äôt broken the seal yet, it‚Äôd be for nothing."QOr if they‚Äôve resealed it. I can try and scout it out, but‚Ä¶ no promises."^My POINT is that if you don‚Äôt help out, you better get used to the look of white stone."]You‚Äôre gonna be seeing a whole lot more of it if someone tells Regigigas to let loose."<Listen, I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know a lot of things."sSo let me talk to Andris, our rangers, Helena, whoever else I can find. We‚Äôll figure out how bad things are."PAnd if these thieves show their faces aboveground, you can brawl with them."~They‚Äôve got at least one Regi, probably more, so there‚Äôs a strong temptation to wreak havoc. Trust me ‚Äì I‚Äôd know."JHate to say it, but you just need to keep being your usual self, kid."JOr, no, I shouldn‚Äôt call you kid. Take this ‚Äì you‚Äôve earned it."AUsed to give these to Chasm strike teams, for cave scouting."UIt‚Äôll get you just about anywhere in the region ‚Äì nobody hides from you now."3So go get those badges and save the day, hero."Who are you?"Why are you doing this?"Shut up, edgelord."Who are they?"What do they want?"Why Yezera?"Not my problem."You wanted power?"You wanted money?"You wanted knowledge?"Why should I care?"Then why is Yezera..."How many Regis are stolen?"They're opening that door."Your point?0Iu; "[["gThe stove is covered with a light dusting of the powdered flavoring that comes with instant ramen."RA game console.

I‚Äôm almost heartbroken."%Well, I suppose I am a stranger."ÄFortunately, I‚Äôve been sent to ensure you make it no farther, so I have a convenient vent for all these feelings of rejection.".Hello, friend. Yezera wishes to be alone."NTo that end, I have been sent, and graciously afforded a titan to aid me."`Before we attend to your removal, however, may I interest you in a short, frank discussion?"RI would rather like to try to convince you of the legitimacy of our position."Thank you for your time."_Yezera‚Äôs goal is to recreate the conditions of the world shortly following its creation."oModern science has attained almost complete understanding and mastery over the world ‚Äì the modern world."éIt cannot, however, understand the past. By reverting existence, we may study the universe from its conception and obtain universal knowledge."#This is the only way to do so."vWithout the reversion, humanity will never attain complete understanding of the universe. It is worth all prices."PNow our time for conversation is up, however. Regice, please do the honors."AAll persons who attempt to advance civilization should care."HUniversal knowledge is a prerequisite for an all- powerful society."\That is my goal. That is the goal of all science: to know, and to apply that knowledge."\Your ignorance implies discussion will get us nowhere. Let us dispense with such, then."<Knowledge will be retained into the new primordial era."8We can rebuild at least small enclaves of humanity."\From there our analysis and conquest will begin: a new society with absolute knowledge."@And, stemming from this absolute knowledge, absolute power."YConsider it. In the mean time, there is the business I mentioned earlier. Excuse me."|I am glad you have the wisdom to agree. If you should wish to support us in our endeavors, I will be happy to have you."xWe will fight for a more enlightened era. For now, however, I must slow you. Business is business. Let us commence."II find this highly unfortunate. You will be left behind by progress."NIf you would prefer to retain your ignorance, however, I cannot help you.",Prepare yourself. Regice, if you would."4Yo. Figure‚Äôd, uh, yeah, that you‚Äôd be here."bYezera‚Äôs here. You keep running into her. She, uh, doesn‚Äôt really want to talk right now."0I got a job to do, but, uh, not keen on it." So you want to hear us out?"]Swear we‚Äôve got some good reasons. Even if I‚Äôm not that good at putting it in words."=Oh. That‚Äôs good. Great. Honestly didn‚Äôt expect that."HWell, I just figure we‚Äôve done a lot of ordering Pok√©mon around.">Maybe it‚Äôs time to even up the footing a bit, y‚Äôknow?"8We can all kinda make up for whatever we did wrong."mThe others have their reasons, but, uh, this is mine. Make a world where we can be forgiven. You get it?"(Well ‚Äì fine. You know what? Fine."bI don‚Äôt need your permission, and we certainly don‚Äôt need your help. Regice. Do ‚Äòem in."Z‚Ä¶You so sure? Takes a lot of pushing to train a team that strong in so little time."4But, yeah, no, I get it. Why would you help us?"?Rich brat. Maybe we can beat some responsibility into you."NUh. Don‚Äôt really know how to break it to you. You‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt have time."EFor one, we‚Äôve already just about won. For two ‚Äì think fast!"(Regice, sweep ‚Äòem off their feet!"*Oh. Didn‚Äôt, uh, really expect that.":Figured you were kind of a stuck-up brat. No offense."=Well, good. Maybe we‚Äôll be side by side one day, yeah?"5But, uh, for now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm supposed to fight you."HSo, uh, sorry ‚Äì ah, what am I saying, we live for this. Ready up."Yeah, I guess that tracks."#Fine. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs fine."5I came here to beat the crap out of you anyways."iOdds are Regice isn‚Äôt gonna stick around much longer, so let‚Äôs make it count. Try your best, eh?"-Well. Had to happen eventually, I guess."II‚Äôve kinda sorta been planning what to say for the past few hours."cBut, um‚Ä¶ I still don‚Äôt know. So can I just say what comes to mind and hope you understand?"BWelp. Listen, uh, Makya‚Äôs kinda in a weird place right now."]Team Chasm ran roughshod over this whole region and then kinda just‚Ä¶ got away with it?"So, uh, yeah, if you ever wanted proof that humans can‚Äôt get even the most black-and-white justice right, there you are."KWould‚Äôve been simple to fix that little screw-up. But they didn‚Äôt."[So we‚Äôre taking the power away from humans, and putting it in the hands of Pok√©mon."Is it? Is it!"AAm I insane for wanting some damn PUNISHMENT in this world?!"DWell, guess what. If people won‚Äôt give me it, I‚Äôll MAKE it.""And I‚Äôve got just the tool!"%It is simple, you ‚Äì you idiot!"aI can track down every ex-Chasm criminal and haul them up to the courts myself if I have to!"UThey just won‚Äôt do anything if I did! So I have to do things personally, yeah?" Sorry. Nothing‚Ä¶ personal."	Yes!"MThey‚Äôre noble and pure and ‚Äì and ‚Äì and they‚Äôd never let me down!"/Unlike you! And everyone else around here!"JYou want to see? C‚Äômon. See what kind of justice Pok√©mon can give!"Oh. Ah-hah."LKinda got myself a bit worked up there‚Ä¶ welp, no harm, no foul, yeah?"‚Ä¶Nah, that‚Äôs stupid."^I‚Äôm not gonna waste this chance. I‚Äôve got a Regi. You‚Äôre a prodigy. Let‚Äôs RUMBLE!"Urgh, you make me so mad!")Nobody will frickin‚Äô listen to me!"
Fine."Y‚Äôknow, fine, whatever."?You get what everyone else I fight gets. What you deserve."ARegice ‚Äì your service has ended. If you would go, then go."YSo it returns to its resting place‚Ä¶ no matter. It has done all I desired and more."%As for you, we shall meet again."YWhen and where, fate shall decide, though I think I know where we shall settle this."8Do not pursue me. Your audience with Yezera awaits.""Seems Regice‚Äôs 'bout spent."ODidn‚Äôt exactly expect them to be so squirrelly, but them‚Äôs the breaks.".Figure it‚Äôs headin‚Äô back to its home."eOne last thing, since you seem ‚Äòbout ready to see Yez again: you hurt her and I‚Äôll find you."=And it won‚Äôt just be for some play fight with animals."sG‚Äôevening, kid. I‚Äôll be seein‚Äô you. Keep in mind how nice it feels to be havin‚Äô all your bones intact."9Au revoir, Regice. Enjoy your entombment, I suppose."XAnd as for you, I‚Äôm breathless. Speechless. You‚Äôre even better than I imagined."OIf you‚Äôd like to stop your pointless struggling against us, tell Yezera."4We‚Äôd love to have you. Until we meet again‚Ä¶"2I surmise Regice will now return to its tomb."SThe titans are temperamental and ill-suited to existence outside their crypts."0It is of no matter. Our victory comes soon."JYezera may be displeased in my performance, but she is understanding."GIn the end, this will make no difference. Thank you for your time."See ya, Regice."Ah, who am I kidding."cIf either of us is gonna see it again, it‚Äôll be you. Couldn‚Äôt really hold a candle to you."UHad to try anyways, just for Yezera. And I‚Äôm gonna have to do it again, right?"VGood practice, I guess. Well, think about it ‚Äì everything, y‚Äôknow? I‚Äôm out."U*sigh* So long, Regice. You never really were my type, anyways, so head on home."HAnd as for YOU, well, next time we talk it‚Äôll be in a fair world!"MIf it isn‚Äôt, then, uh, I‚Äôll have to buy us a li‚Äôl more time, 'kay?"FUntil then, I‚Äôve got judgment to be a-judging. So long, "hero.""No."	Yes."I'll listen."Don't need it."No, I don‚Äôt."That's tenuous."I'll think about it."
I do."Fine, talk."Not interested in talking."I know who you are."Don't threaten me."Clear."Wish that already."I'm with you."Alright, fine."Go away."That's insane."Degenerate?"Arceus's bosom?"That's fair."Sure, talk."Don't really care."It isn't worth it."Who cares?"Society will crumble."Good point."Don't care."You're wrong."I'm not guilty."

I asked, "I was already walled.""^My rival smiled, "You were swept before the game started; the set up is the whole point.""áOne night while meditating, I was approached by a Chasm grunt who demanded my possessions: my items, my Pokemon, the shirt off my back."BI quickly complied. Now naked and cold, I resumed meditation."Q"My poor fellow," I said to myself, "I wish I could give you my skill, too.""IMy old rival predicted my every swap until I became afraid to pivot."6"How do you guess correctly every time?" I asked."bMy old rival smiled. "I limit your options until you have only one choice," my rival replied."*"And then you have no choice at all.""W"Why do you play worse the closer you get to the finish line?" my old rival asked."FI thought for a moment and replied, "because I'm afraid to lose.""BMy old rival smiled. "Are you sure you're not afraid to win?""wI met my old rival at a petting zoo.

We're not meant to be alone.""I"I'm playing terribly," I told my old rival. "I'm not going to win.""'"This too shall pass," he replied."~That night I beat the gym and raced to tell him, "Thank you for your advice. I cannot tell you how happy I am right now.""0My old rival smiled. "This too shall pass.""<Ugh, a year of training and I'm out in the first round.",Wish I qualified for one of the byes..."vI went and purchased a Shiny Stone to pull out an Aegislash later, but I guess I don't have a use for it anymore."So uhh, here."

Speed ties are decided randomly."Attacking vs Status"~Attacking moves deal damage. Status moves do not. Status moves are notated by a Yin/Yang symbol (White and Black intermixing)."Physical vs Special"§Attacking moves are split into Physical moves, and Special moves. Each of these categories uses different stats to determine how much damage is dealt to the target."Physical Moves"•Physical moves are notated by the symbol of a smashing fist. Their damage is based on the Attack (Atk) stat of the attacker and the Defense (Def) stat of the target."Special Moves"´Special moves are notated by the symbol of a splash. Their damage is based on the Special Attack (Sp. Atk) of the attacker and the Special Defense (Sp. Def) of the target."Targeting"µMost moves target only a single Pok√©mon, but many can target multiple Pok√©mon at once. Some moves differ in how far they can target in the bigger battle styles (doubles, triples)."Move Types"£Every move has a type. Attacking moves deal different amounts of damage to different Pok√©mon based on those Pok√©mon's types. This is called 'type effectiveness'."Same-Type Bonus"öPok√©mon deal 50% more damage with moves the share a type with them. For example, a Raichu deals 50% more damage with an Electric move than a Normal move."Learning Moves"äPok√©mon learn new moves as they level up. They can also learn moves from the 'Move Tutors' who sit in the left side of every Pok√©Center."Base Power"èMoves with higher Base Power deal more damage. Some moves deal variable Base Power depending on the situation. Status moves have no base power."ñAccuracy is a move's chance of hitting. Most moves have 100% accuracy. Some effects can raise accuracy to let you use low-accuracy moves consistently."Power Points"äPower Points, or PP, is a number which limits how many times a move can be used. Healing at a Pok√©Center or with the Aid Kit restores PP."óEach Pok√©mon has type weakness and type resistances based on its own type. eg. Water deals double damage to Fire, and Fire deals half damage to Water."Type Combinations"±When a Pok√©mon has two types, its type weaknesses and resistances multiply. A Pok√©mon can be double weak or double resistant, or immune even though one of their types is weak."Normal Effective"SNormal Effective is the default effectiveness of all moves against a Pok√©mon."Super Effective"USuper Effective moves deal double the damage compared to normal effective moves."Hyper Effective"äHyper Effective moves deal quadruple the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a Pok√©mon is double weak to a type."Not Very Effective"VNot Very Effective moves deal half the damage compared to normal effective moves."Barely Effective"íBarely Effective moves deal one quarter the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a Pok√©mon is double resistant to a type."Ineffective"ØIneffective moves deal no damage at all. This can happen if one of a Pok√©mon's types has an immunity to the attacking move type, even if the other is neutral (or even weak!)."Looking Up Matchups"ëThe 5th and 6th pages of a MasterDex entry show that Pok√©mon's type matchups. Open the MasterDex in battle to check matchups if you're not sure."Psychic vs Steel"PPsychic is now Super-Effective vs Steel. Think of magicians bending spoons."Poison vs Water"RPoison is now Super-Effective vs Water. Think of chemicals polluting a river."Bug vs Fairy"LBug is now Super-Effective vs Fairy. Think of insects scaring children."Grass resistances"UGrass now resists Fairy, Psychic, and Ghost. Think of incense warding off magic."Ice resistances"iIce now resists Flying and Ground. Ice is Super-Effective against those types, so it's only natural!"Other changes"`Rock resists Ice. Fairy resists Dragon. Fairy is neutral against Fire. Bug resists Psychic."Why Get More?"ùHaving choices of Pok√©mon is important when facing challenges. A team of six is a bare minimum--it's best to catch more and pull them from the PC as needed."Methods of Aquiring"ãThe two main methods of acquiring Pok√©mon are catching them from the wild, and receiving them from other Trainers through gifts or trades."Catching Basics"ÆWild Pok√©mon will attack you if you walk through patches of grass, dark ground in caves, or other wild terrain. You can catch these Pok√©mon by throwing Pok√© Balls at them." Increase Catch Chance pt. 1"õCatching a Pok√©mon isn't guaranteed. It's easier to catch Pok√©mon when their health has been lowered by your attacks, or when they have a status ailment." Increase Catch Chance pt. 2"±Every time a Pok√©mon breaks out of a ball, it'll be slightly easier to catch for the rest of the battle. You can check what your current catch chance is in the Pok√© Ball menu."Finding Wild Pok√©mon"™Use the DexNav to get information on which Pok√©mon are available where you are. You can also use it to find more Pok√©mon of a species that you've already caught one of."Trades"éThroughout the world there will be people offering trades for Pok√©mon. Usually they want a different Pok√©mon, but sometimes they want money."What are Stats?"gStats, short for Statistics, are the numbers which determine how your Pok√©mon performs in battle."Checking Stats"äCheck your Pok√©mon's stats by looking at the second page of their summary screen, accessible through the Pok√©mon menu in the pause menu."Stat Factors"òYour Pok√©mon's stats are calculated from a combination of their species' 'Base Stats', their own 'Style Points', and extra modifications during battle."Base Stats"≠Every species of Pok√©mon have base stats, which affect every Pok√©mon of that species. e.g. Every Raichu will be fast because the Raichu species has a high Speed base stat."Style Points"îStyle Points are numbers which you can customize to change your Pok√©mon's stats. Style Points show as blue numbers on the stat page of the summary."Leveling and Evolution"ÖYour Pok√©mon's stats will increase every time they level up. When Pok√©mon evolve, their stats change (almost always they increase)."Accuracy and Evasion"êAccuracy and Evasion are two stats which are only active in battle, starting at 100% each. They are only modified by in-battle changing effects."Stat Steps"ìEffects can modify a Pok√©mon's stats during battle. These are called 'stat steps'. Stat steps multiply or divide the Pok√©mon's listed stat value."Bounds of Stat Steps"éStat steps start at 0, and can increase up to +12 (4x) and down to -12 (.25x). Stat steps are reset if you swap the Pok√©mon out or it faints."Checking Stat Steps"úYou can check the current stat steps of each Pok√©mon on the battlefield using the Info button. It lists the numerical step as well as resultant multiplier."What are abilities?"Abilities are special powers that Pok√©mon can have based on their species. Most Pok√©mon can have one of 2 possible abilities."Ability Effects"ãAbilities do a wide variety of different things. Understanding your team's abilities, and choosing the right ones, is important to winning."Checking Abilities"ãCheck your Pok√©mon's summary to see what ability they have. Use the MasterDex to read about the abilities of enemy Pok√©mon during battle."Choosing Abilities"êA Pok√©mon's ability is one of the two its species can have, randomly chosen when you get it. You can use Ability Capsules to swap to the other."Conditional Abilities"ÉMany abilities only do things under certain circumstances. Building around Weather and Room-synergy abilities is a common strategy."Effect Of Evolution"{A Pok√©mon's ability tends to stay the same when evolving, but can change. When this happens, the game will alert you."Defeating Abilities"ÉAn enemy Trainer's ability too much? Abilities like Neutralizing Gas, and moves like Gastro Acid, can suppress abilities in battle."Swapping Abilities"Moves like Skill Swap can be used to give a new ability to Pok√©mon during battle, enabling unique and creative team synergies."What are Held Items?"êHeld items are items which you can give your Pok√©mon to benefit them during battle. They can increase their damage, heal them, or other things."Equipping an item"ÜYou can give a Pok√©mon an item from your bag, or through the summary screen. Not all items do an effect when held, so read carefully."Berries"ÜBerries are a common held item. During battles, Pok√©mon will eat the berry to get a benefit. Get berries by picking from Berry Trees."Sitrus and Amwi Berry"£Sitrus Berry and Cado Berry are common berries which heal your Pok√©mon when at low health. If in doubt about what item to give a Pok√©mon, give them one of these."Rematerializer"~In Pok√©mon Tectonic, the Rematerializer regenerates held items which are consumed in battle. You'll never run out of berries!"Wild Held Items"hWild Pok√©mon can be found holding items. These items sometimes have held effects, but often don't."Getting More"ûYou will find more held items on the ground when traveling, or as gifts from people, or as the reward for defeating Avatars, or as purchasable items in shops." What are Status Conditions?"âStatus Conditions are ailments a Pok√©mon can have which hurt or restrict them. They remain after swapping out, and even between battles."Healing Status Conditions"`Status Conditions are removed when you heal at the Pok√©Center or when you use the Aid Kit."Status Immunity"áType immunities do not prevent status moves. However, some types give immunities to certain status conditions. Don't confuse these two!"çWhen burned, a Pok√©mon's Attack is reduced by 33%, and loses 1/8th HP every turn. Fire- and Ghost-types do the most burning. Fire is immune."Frostbite"ñWhen frostbitten, a Pok√©mon's Sp. Atk is reduced by 33%, and loses 1/8th HP every turn. Ice- and Flying-types do the most frostbiting. Ice is immune."ôWhen poisoned, a Pok√©mon loses 1/10th HP every turn. This doubles every 2 turns. Poison- and Grass-types do the most poisoning. Poison/Steel are immune."éWhen numbed, a Pok√©mon's Speed is halved, and it deals 25% less damage. Electric- and Fighting-types do the most numbing. Electric is immune."áWhen dizzied, a Pok√©mon takes 25% more attack damage, and its ability doesn't function. Psychic- and Fairy-types do the most dizzying."ñWhen leeched, a Pok√©mon loses 1/10th HP every turn, and its opponent(s) split that health. Bug- and Dark-types do the most leeching. Grass is immune."çA rarer status that causes a Pok√©mon to be unable to do anything for 2 turns. Psychic- and Grass-types put Pok√©mon to sleep the most often."What are Tribes?"®Every Pok√©mon has 1-3 Tribes, decided by their species. Have 5 Pok√©mon of a shared Tribe on your team, and your entire team will receive that Tribe's bonus in battle!"Tribal Bonus"õTribal Bonuses are not identical: each Tribe provides a unique boon. With careful team composition, you can have 2 or even 3 Tribal Bonuses active at once!"Are they important?"îTribes are not required in any way to complete the game. They are simply an alternative team-building challenge to play with, like Single Type runs."What are Critical Hits?"zA critical hit deals 50% more damage than a regular hit. These naturally happen at random times on any damaging move.""How common are Critical Hits?"pThe base critical hit chance is 1 in 16. This chance can be raised by abilities, items, or special effects."Other Effects"ùCritical hits ignore stat steps (on the user or the target) that would lower their damage. They also ignore protective screens like Reflect and Light Screen."Preventing Criticals"üCertain abilities prevent critical hits against that Pokemon. The Lucky Chant effect and the Strategist tribe bonus also protect their side from critical hits."Guaranteed Criticals"ïSome moves or abilities are not random, but guarantee a critical hit under certain conditions. Otherwise, these act the same as random critical hits."}Avatars cannot perform random critical hits. However, they can perform guaranteed critical hits from moves or abilities."What are Enemy Trainers?"îEnemy Trainers are the Pok√©mon Trainers you will battle throughout the game. Some block your path forwards (like Gym Leaders), others are optional."Detecting Trainers"îTrainers are people who have a companion Pok√©mon next to them. If a person doesn't have that, they either aren't a Trainer, or are an inactive one."Avoiding Trainers"üTrainers will challenge you if they see you within 4 tiles of them. Avoid them by going out of that distance, sneaking around them, or waiting until they move."Trainer Inactivity"≥When you defeat a Trainer, they will become inactive until the next time you heal at a Pok√©Center. This is indicated by them returning their companion Pok√©mon to its Pok√© Ball."Perfecting Fights"õIf you defeat a Trainer without any of your Pok√©mon fainting, you've 'perfected' the fight. They will leave forever and drop experience candy as a reward."Enemy Teams"õEnemy Trainers have their own teams of Pok√©mon with their own moves and held items. It's important to pay attention to these possibilities to win battles."Differences"ùThe typical trainer has 3 Pok√©mon, but Gym Leaders will have more. Trainers with more Pok√©mon also have more move variety and more items on their Pok√©mon."Pro Trainers"∞Pro Trainers are special Trainers, noted by their grey hair and black clothes. Their teams are always 6 Pok√©mon, all with items, and built around a Tribal Bonus. They're hard!"Trainer Behaviour"§Individual Trainers will always react to the same in-battle circumstances the same way. You can learn how to beat or even perfect a Trainer through trial and error."What are Avatars?"àAvatars are powerful enemy Pok√©mon with unique properties that you will fight and destroy during your adventure. They cannot be caught."Avatars are Healthy"rAvatars have two health bars, which means they have a lot of health. Much more than double the normal amount!"Multi-Move"}Avatars can move twice each turn. Their second move will happen after every battler has used their regular move for the turn."Two Statuses"{Avatars are large, and have room for up to two status conditions at a time. They can't have two of the same condition."HP-Based Effects"ÄEffects that damage based on a fraction of total HP are only one-sixth as powerful against avatars, compared to normal Pok√©mon."Primeval Moves"ùWhen a health bar is depleted, avatars will use a Primeval Move! Primeval Moves are powered-up versions of status moves, which also change the Avatar's type."Clean Slate"èBefore an Avatar uses a Primeval Move, they will also heal from any status conditions and reset any of their stat steps that have been lowered."Shields"çThe top of Avatars health bars starts Shielded. Shielded bars take 75% less damage. A shield is removed when the Avatar uses a Primeval Move."Attack Choice"|Avatars usually only have a few moves to choose from. They usually alternate between their moves on successive attacks."Target Choice"õA targeting reticle shows which of your battles the Avatar wants to attack. It will switch to another battler, however, if their attack is made impossible."Empowered Moves"âSome Avatars have Empowered attacks, which are powered-up versions of other attacks. They take up both of an Avatar's moves on that turn."Experience Reward"oWhen an Avatar is destroyed, every Pok√©mon on your team is given experience, even those that are fainted."Legendary Avatars"ìLegendary Avatars are unique. You fight them with 3 Pok√©mon, they have 3 HP bars, and they have more moves with more smarts about how to use them."What is the MasterDex?"^The MasterDex is an advanced encyclopedia about the 900+ Pok√©mon available in this game."Single MasterDex"ãAccess the MasterDex entry of a single Pok√©mon when looking at a Pok√©mon in the summary or the PC, or by using the Dex button in battles."Full MasterDex"óAccess the full MasterDex from your pause menu, or by pressing D when using the Dex button in battles (while it's waiting for you to select a battler)."Searching"úWhen in the MasterDex, you can press your Special keybind (default Shift or Z) to open the first search page.

Only one weather can be active at once."Weather Duration"¢Weathers last a certain number of turns. The length differs depending on what move or ability summoned the weather. The duration can be extended by certain items."Sunshine"ïSunshine lowers attack damage by 15% and prevents crits. Fire and Grass-type moves/Pok√©mon are immune to this. Fire-type attacks are boosted by 30%."ØRainstorm lowers attack damage by 15% and makes added effects half as likely. Water and Electric-type moves/Pok√©mon are immune to this. Water-type attacks are boosted by 30%."úSandstorm deals damage to all Pok√©mon at the end of each turn. Rock and Ground-types are immune to this. Additionally, Rock-types get +50% Special Defense."åHail deals damage to all Pok√©mon at the end of each turn. Ice and Ghost-types are immune to this. Additionally, Ice-types get +50% Defense."®Eclipse lowers all stats of all Pok√©mon every 4 turns (by 2 steps). Psychic and Dragon-types are immune to this. Additionally, Psychic-type attacks are boosted by 30%."Moonglow"ãMoonglow flinches all Pok√©mon every 4 turns. Fairy and Dark-types are immune to this. Additionally, Fairy-type attacks are boosted by 30%."Weather Downsides"ìEach weather has both an upside and a downside. There are items and abilities that make your Pok√©mon immune to these downsides regardless of type."Weather Areas"õCertain areas in the game experience intense weather. That weather will also be present in the battles of that area. Simple daily weather will not do this."Weather Synergies"¢Each weather has dozens of moves and abilities that benefit from that weather. Pok√©mon using these moves/abilities ignore the downsides of their favored weather!"yUse the Arrow keys to move the main character.

You lose a battle if that happens to your Pok√©mon."í1. Have as many Pok√©mon as you can. 2. Level up your Pok√©mon as much as you can. 3. Abuse type matchups. 4. Start battles with healthy Pok√©mon."Team Size"ñYou can have a maximum of 6 Pok√©mon with you at any time. This is known as your 'Team'. You can store extra Pok√©mon using the PC in any Pok√©Center."Levels"©Each Pok√©mon has a level from 1 to 70. A Pok√©mon's level determines its stats as well as what moves it could learn. Reaching high enough levels also unlocks Evolution."èTypes are strong or weak against other types. Having a variety of different types on your team helps you take advantage of these relationships."Healing your Pok√©mon"yHeal your Pok√©mon at Pok√©Centers between battles. You can often use the Aid Kit instead to save on traveling time."Who goes first?"âIn battle, the Pok√©mon with the higher speed stat gets to use their move first. Some moves modify this. Speed ties are decided randomly."Attacking vs Status"~Attacking moves deal damage. Status moves do not. Status moves are notated by a Yin/Yang symbol (White and Black intermixing)."Physical vs Special"§Attacking moves are split into Physical moves, and Special moves. Each of these categories uses different stats to determine how much damage is dealt to the target."Physical Moves"•Physical moves are notated by the symbol of a smashing fist. Their damage is based on the Attack (Atk) stat of the attacker and the Defense (Def) stat of the target."Special Moves"´Special moves are notated by the symbol of a splash. Their damage is based on the Special Attack (Sp. Atk) of the attacker and the Special Defense (Sp. Def) of the target."Targeting"µMost moves target only a single Pok√©mon, but many can target multiple Pok√©mon at once. Some moves differ in how far they can target in the bigger battle styles (doubles, triples)."Move Types"£Every move has a type. Attacking moves deal different amounts of damage to different Pok√©mon based on those Pok√©mon's types. This is called 'type effectiveness'."Same-Type Bonus"öPok√©mon deal 50% more damage with moves the share a type with them. For example, a Raichu deals 50% more damage with an Electric move than a Normal move."Learning Moves"äPok√©mon learn new moves as they level up. They can also learn moves from the 'Move Tutors' who sit in the left side of every Pok√©Center."Base Power"èMoves with higher Base Power deal more damage. Some moves deal variable Base Power depending on the situation. Status moves have no base power."ñAccuracy is a move's chance of hitting. Most moves have 100% accuracy. Some effects can raise accuracy to let you use low-accuracy moves consistently."Power Points"äPower Points, or PP, is a number which limits how many times a move can be used. Healing at a Pok√©Center or with the Aid Kit restores PP."óEach Pok√©mon has type weakness and type resistances based on its own type. eg. Water deals double damage to Fire, and Fire deals half damage to Water."Type Combinations"±When a Pok√©mon has two types, its type weaknesses and resistances multiply. A Pok√©mon can be double weak or double resistant, or immune even though one of their types is weak."Normal Effective"SNormal Effective is the default effectiveness of all moves against a Pok√©mon."Super Effective"USuper Effective moves deal double the damage compared to normal effective moves."Hyper Effective"äHyper Effective moves deal quadruple the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a Pok√©mon is double weak to a type."Not Very Effective"VNot Very Effective moves deal half the damage compared to normal effective moves."Barely Effective"íBarely Effective moves deal one quarter the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a Pok√©mon is double resistant to a type."Ineffective"ØIneffective moves deal no damage at all. This can happen if one of a Pok√©mon's types has an immunity to the attacking move type, even if the other is neutral (or even weak!)."Looking Up Matchups"ëThe 5th and 6th pages of a MasterDex entry show that Pok√©mon's type matchups. Open the MasterDex in battle to check matchups if you're not sure."Psychic vs Steel"PPsychic is now Super-Effective vs Steel. Think of magicians bending spoons."Poison vs Water"RPoison is now Super-Effective vs Water. Think of chemicals polluting a river."Bug vs Fairy"LBug is now Super-Effective vs Fairy. Think of insects scaring children."Grass resistances"UGrass now resists Fairy, Psychic, and Ghost. Think of incense warding off magic."Ice resistances"iIce now resists Flying and Ground. Ice is Super-Effective against those types, so it's only natural!"Other changes"`Rock resists Ice. Fairy resists Dragon. Fairy is neutral against Fire. Bug resists Psychic."Why Get More?"ùHaving choices of Pok√©mon is important when facing challenges. A team of six is a bare minimum--it's best to catch more and pull them from the PC as needed."Methods of Aquiring"ãThe two main methods of acquiring Pok√©mon are catching them from the wild, and receiving them from other Trainers through gifts or trades."Catching Basics"ÆWild Pok√©mon will attack you if you walk through patches of grass, dark ground in caves, or other wild terrain. You can catch these Pok√©mon by throwing Pok√© Balls at them." Increase Catch Chance pt. 1"õCatching a Pok√©mon isn't guaranteed. It's easier to catch Pok√©mon when their health has been lowered by your attacks, or when they have a status ailment." Increase Catch Chance pt. 2"±Every time a Pok√©mon breaks out of a ball, it'll be slightly easier to catch for the rest of the battle. You can check what your current catch chance is in the Pok√© Ball menu."Finding Wild Pok√©mon"™Use the DexNav to get information on which Pok√©mon are available where you are. You can also use it to find more Pok√©mon of a species that you've already caught one of."Trades"éThroughout the world there will be people offering trades for Pok√©mon. Usually they want a different Pok√©mon, but sometimes they want money."What are Stats?"gStats, short for Statistics, are the numbers which determine how your Pok√©mon performs in battle."Checking Stats"äCheck your Pok√©mon's stats by looking at the second page of their summary screen, accessible through the Pok√©mon menu in the pause menu."Stat Factors"òYour Pok√©mon's stats are calculated from a combination of their species' 'Base Stats', their own 'Style Points', and extra modifications during battle."Base Stats"≠Every species of Pok√©mon have base stats, which affect every Pok√©mon of that species. e.g. Every Raichu will be fast because the Raichu species has a high Speed base stat."Style Points"îStyle Points are numbers which you can customize to change your Pok√©mon's stats. Style Points show as blue numbers on the stat page of the summary."Leveling and Evolution"ÖYour Pok√©mon's stats will increase every time they level up. When Pok√©mon evolve, their stats change (almost always they increase)."Accuracy and Evasion"êAccuracy and Evasion are two stats which are only active in battle, starting at 100% each. They are only modified by in-battle changing effects."Stat Steps"ìEffects can modify a Pok√©mon's stats during battle. These are called 'stat steps'. Stat steps multiply or divide the Pok√©mon's listed stat value."Bounds of Stat Steps"éStat steps start at 0, and can increase up to +12 (4x) and down to -12 (.25x). Stat steps are reset if you swap the Pok√©mon out or it faints."Checking Stat Steps"úYou can check the current stat steps of each Pok√©mon on the battlefield using the Info button. It lists the numerical step as well as resultant multiplier."What are abilities?"Abilities are special powers that Pok√©mon can have based on their species. Most Pok√©mon can have one of 2 possible abilities."Ability Effects"ãAbilities do a wide variety of different things. Understanding your team's abilities, and choosing the right ones, is important to winning."Checking Abilities"ãCheck your Pok√©mon's summary to see what ability they have. Use the MasterDex to read about the abilities of enemy Pok√©mon during battle."Choosing Abilities"êA Pok√©mon's ability is one of the two its species can have, randomly chosen when you get it. You can use Ability Capsules to swap to the other."Conditional Abilities"ÉMany abilities only do things under certain circumstances. Building around Weather and Room-synergy abilities is a common strategy."Effect Of Evolution"{A Pok√©mon's ability tends to stay the same when evolving, but can change. When this happens, the game will alert you."Defeating Abilities"ÉAn enemy Trainer's ability too much? Abilities like Neutralizing Gas, and moves like Gastro Acid, can suppress abilities in battle."Swapping Abilities"Moves like Skill Swap can be used to give a new ability to Pok√©mon during battle, enabling unique and creative team synergies."What are Held Items?"êHeld items are items which you can give your Pok√©mon to benefit them during battle. They can increase their damage, heal them, or other things."Equipping an item"ÜYou can give a Pok√©mon an item from your bag, or through the summary screen. Not all items do an effect when held, so read carefully."Berries"ÜBerries are a common held item. During battles, Pok√©mon will eat the berry to get a benefit. Get berries by picking from Berry Trees."Sitrus and Amwi Berry"£Sitrus Berry and Cado Berry are common berries which heal your Pok√©mon when at low health. If in doubt about what item to give a Pok√©mon, give them one of these."Rematerializer"~In Pok√©mon Tectonic, the Rematerializer regenerates held items which are consumed in battle. You'll never run out of berries!"Wild Held Items"hWild Pok√©mon can be found holding items. These items sometimes have held effects, but often don't."Getting More"ûYou will find more held items on the ground when traveling, or as gifts from people, or as the reward for defeating Avatars, or as purchasable items in shops." What are Status Conditions?"âStatus Conditions are ailments a Pok√©mon can have which hurt or restrict them. They remain after swapping out, and even between battles."Healing Status Conditions"`Status Conditions are removed when you heal at the Pok√©Center or when you use the Aid Kit."Status Immunity"áType immunities do not prevent status moves. However, some types give immunities to certain status conditions. Don't confuse these two!"çWhen burned, a Pok√©mon's Attack is reduced by 33%, and loses 1/8th HP every turn. Fire- and Ghost-types do the most burning. Fire is immune."Frostbite"ñWhen frostbitten, a Pok√©mon's Sp. Atk is reduced by 33%, and loses 1/8th HP every turn. Ice- and Flying-types do the most frostbiting. Ice is immune."ôWhen poisoned, a Pok√©mon loses 1/10th HP every turn. This doubles every 2 turns. Poison- and Grass-types do the most poisoning. Poison/Steel are immune."éWhen numbed, a Pok√©mon's Speed is halved, and it deals 25% less damage. Electric- and Fighting-types do the most numbing. Electric is immune."áWhen dizzied, a Pok√©mon takes 25% more attack damage, and its ability doesn't function. Psychic- and Fairy-types do the most dizzying."ñWhen leeched, a Pok√©mon loses 1/10th HP every turn, and its opponent(s) split that health. Bug- and Dark-types do the most leeching. Grass is immune."çA rarer status that causes a Pok√©mon to be unable to do anything for 2 turns. Psychic- and Grass-types put Pok√©mon to sleep the most often."What are Tribes?"®Every Pok√©mon has 1-3 Tribes, decided by their species. Have 5 Pok√©mon of a shared Tribe on your team, and your entire team will receive that Tribe's bonus in battle!"Tribal Bonus"õTribal Bonuses are not identical: each Tribe provides a unique boon. With careful team composition, you can have 2 or even 3 Tribal Bonuses active at once!"Are they important?"îTribes are not required in any way to complete the game. They are simply an alternative team-building challenge to play with, like Single Type runs."What are Critical Hits?"zA critical hit deals 50% more damage than a regular hit. These naturally happen at random times on any damaging move.""How common are Critical Hits?"pThe base critical hit chance is 1 in 16. This chance can be raised by abilities, items, or special effects."Other Effects"ùCritical hits ignore stat steps (on the user or the target) that would lower their damage. They also ignore protective screens like Reflect and Light Screen."Preventing Criticals"üCertain abilities prevent critical hits against that Pokemon. The Lucky Chant effect and the Strategist tribe bonus also protect their side from critical hits."Guaranteed Criticals"ïSome moves or abilities are not random, but guarantee a critical hit under certain conditions. Otherwise, these act the same as random critical hits."}Avatars cannot perform random critical hits. However, they can perform guaranteed critical hits from moves or abilities."What are Enemy Trainers?"îEnemy Trainers are the Pok√©mon Trainers you will battle throughout the game. Some block your path forwards (like Gym Leaders), others are optional."Detecting Trainers"îTrainers are people who have a companion Pok√©mon next to them. If a person doesn't have that, they either aren't a Trainer, or are an inactive one."Avoiding Trainers"üTrainers will challenge you if they see you within 4 tiles of them. Avoid them by going out of that distance, sneaking around them, or waiting until they move."Trainer Inactivity"≥When you defeat a Trainer, they will become inactive until the next time you heal at a Pok√©Center. This is indicated by them returning their companion Pok√©mon to its Pok√© Ball."Perfecting Fights"õIf you defeat a Trainer without any of your Pok√©mon fainting, you've 'perfected' the fight. They will leave forever and drop experience candy as a reward."Enemy Teams"õEnemy Trainers have their own teams of Pok√©mon with their own moves and held items. It's important to pay attention to these possibilities to win battles."Differences"ùThe typical trainer has 3 Pok√©mon, but Gym Leaders will have more. Trainers with more Pok√©mon also have more move variety and more items on their Pok√©mon."Pro Trainers"∞Pro Trainers are special Trainers, noted by their grey hair and black clothes. Their teams are always 6 Pok√©mon, all with items, and built around a Tribal Bonus. They're hard!"Trainer Behaviour"§Individual Trainers will always react to the same in-battle circumstances the same way. You can learn how to beat or even perfect a Trainer through trial and error."What are Avatars?"àAvatars are powerful enemy Pok√©mon with unique properties that you will fight and destroy during your adventure. They cannot be caught."Avatars are Healthy"rAvatars have two health bars, which means they have a lot of health. Much more than double the normal amount!"Multi-Move"}Avatars can move twice each turn. Their second move will happen after every battler has used their regular move for the turn."Two Statuses"{Avatars are large, and have room for up to two status conditions at a time. They can't have two of the same condition."HP-Based Effects"ÄEffects that damage based on a fraction of total HP are only one-sixth as powerful against avatars, compared to normal Pok√©mon."Primeval Moves"ùWhen a health bar is depleted, avatars will use a Primeval Move! Primeval Moves are powered-up versions of status moves, which also change the Avatar's type."Clean Slate"èBefore an Avatar uses a Primeval Move, they will also heal from any status conditions and reset any of their stat steps that have been lowered."Shields"çThe top of Avatars health bars starts Shielded. Shielded bars take 75% less damage. A shield is removed when the Avatar uses a Primeval Move."Attack Choice"|Avatars usually only have a few moves to choose from. They usually alternate between their moves on successive attacks."Target Choice"õA targeting reticle shows which of your battles the Avatar wants to attack. It will switch to another battler, however, if their attack is made impossible."Empowered Moves"âSome Avatars have Empowered attacks, which are powered-up versions of other attacks. They take up both of an Avatar's moves on that turn."Experience Reward"oWhen an Avatar is destroyed, every Pok√©mon on your team is given experience, even those that are fainted."Legendary Avatars"ìLegendary Avatars are unique. You fight them with 3 Pok√©mon, they have 3 HP bars, and they have more moves with more smarts about how to use them."What is the MasterDex?"^The MasterDex is an advanced encyclopedia about the 900+ Pok√©mon available in this game."Single MasterDex"ãAccess the MasterDex entry of a single Pok√©mon when looking at a Pok√©mon in the summary or the PC, or by using the Dex button in battles."Full MasterDex"óAccess the full MasterDex from your pause menu, or by pressing D when using the Dex button in battles (while it's waiting for you to select a battler)."Searching"úWhen in the MasterDex, you can press your Special keybind (default Shift or Z) to open the first search page.

Only one weather can be active at once."Weather Duration"¢Weathers last a certain number of turns. The length differs depending on what move or ability summoned the weather. The duration can be extended by certain items."Sunshine"ïSunshine lowers attack damage by 15% and prevents crits. Fire and Grass-type moves/Pok√©mon are immune to this. Fire-type attacks are boosted by 30%."ØRainstorm lowers attack damage by 15% and makes added effects half as likely. Water and Electric-type moves/Pok√©mon are immune to this.
